If you happen to be visiting this repository, chances are, you are a student at IIT Bombay. This repository contains notes I took in various formats, predominantly handwritten but sometimes in markdown. To view the markdown files as I did while writing, you can use this [wonderful app](https://github.com/notable/notable) (or any note taking app that supports KaTeX). Plus I don't think you will find any first year resource on this repository. 

Maybe someday if I get the time, I will typeset these all in LaTeX
