# HS 101: Chapter 4: The Market Forces Of Supply And Demand

> HS 101: Economics

Markets are Usually a Good Way to Organise Economic Activity

## Markets And Competition

 - S & D refers to the *behaviour* of people as they *interact* with one another in markets
 - Market
 - Buyers (as a group) determine the demand
 - Sellers (as a group) determine the supply
 - Types of Markets

### Competitive Markets

 - Sometimes markets are highly organised - B & S meet at a specific place, at a specific time
   - Most often, not so

### Competition: Perfect and Otherwise

 - Characterstics of *perfectly competitive markets*:
   - All sellers offer same products
   - There are numerous B & S. Single buyer or seller can't influence the market price (they are called *price takers*)
   - Eg: Wheat market
 - Example of not perfectly competitive market: Monopoly
 - Between extremes - Oligopoly - few sellers, same product. Eg: Airline carriers
 - Outside above spectrum - *monopolistically competitive* - many sellers, slightly different products. Eg: Smartphone industry
 - Markets are assumed to be perfectly competitive in this chapter - easiest to analyse

## Demand

 - Behaviour of buyers - quantity demanded

### Determining the Quantity an Individual Demands

 - Price
   - Quantity Demanded $\alpha$ $\frac{1}{Price}$ , i.e., negatively related
   - Aka, **law of demand**
 - Income
   - Normal and Inferior Goods
 - Prices of related goods
   - Substitutes and Complements
 - Tastes
   - Economists do not try to explain tastes. Only examine them
   - Tastes are based on historical and psychological forces
 - Expectations
   - Expecting higher income next month $\rightarrow$ more willing to spend current savings
   - Expecting prices to fall tomorrow $\rightarrow$ less willing to buy today

### Demand Schedule and Demand Curve

 - All variables except price are constant

### Market Demand vs Individual Demand

 - Market demand = $\Sigma$ individual demands (for a particular good or service)
   - Depends on all those factors of individual demands + number of buyers
   - Market demand curve = $\Sigma$ individual demand curves horizontally (along quantity demanded)

### Shifts in the Demand Curve

 - Whenever any determinant of demand changes, other than the good’s price, the demand curve shifts
   - A change in price represents a movement along it
   - Any change that raises the quantity that buyers wish to purchase at a given price shifts the demand curve to the right
   - Any change that lowers the quantity - shifts the curve to the left

### Case Study: Quantity of Smoking Demanded

 - Shifting the demand curve (to the left):
   - Public service announcements
   - Mandatory health warnings
   - Prohibting advertisements
 - Moving along the curve:
   - Raising the price by taxing manaufacturers who in turn charge the consumers higher
 - Opponents of cigarette taxes argue that tobacco and marijuana are substitutes
 - Studies show that tobacco acts as a *gateway drug* $\Rightarrow$ they are complements

## Supply

 - Behaviour of sellers - quantity supplied

### Determining the Quantity an Individual Supplies

 - Price
   - High price of a product $\rightarrow$ selling it is profitable
   - Price $\alpha$ quantity supplied, i.e., positively related
   - Aka **law of supply**
 - Input prices
   - Raw materials, labour, operation costs
   - Input price increase $\rightarrow$ profits decreases $\rightarrow$ quantity supplied decreases
 - Technology
   - Advancement in tech $\rightarrow$ reduces operating costs $\rightarrow$ quantity supplied increase
 - Expectations
   - Expecting prices to rise tomorrow $\rightarrow$ supply less today

### Supply Schedule and Supply Curve

### Market Supply vs Individual Supply

 - Market supply = $\Sigma$ Supplies of all sellers
   - Depends on all those factors of individual supply + number of sellers

### Shifts in the Supply Curve

 - Whenever there is a change in any determinant of supply, other than the good’s price, the supply curve shifts
   - Any change that raises quantity supplied at every price shifts the supply curve to the right
   - Any change that reduces quantity supplied - shifts the curve to the left
   - A change in the price represents a movement along the supply curve
 - Market supply curve = $\Sigma$ Individual supply curves horizontally

## Supply and Demand Together

### Equilibrium

 - Intersection of supply and demand curves - market's equilibrium
   - (x,y) = (Equ. Quantity, Equ. Price)
   - Equ. price aka *market-clearing* price
 - The actions of buyers and sellers naturally move markets toward the equilibrium
 - Market Price > Equ. Price $\Rightarrow$ Surplus
   - Sellers respond by cutting prices
 - Market Price < Equ. Price $\Rightarrow$ Shortage
   - Sellers respond by raising prices
 - Speed of reaching equilibrium varies from market to market, depending on how quickly prices adjust
 - The price of any good adjusts to bring the S & D into balance. Aka **law of S & D**

### Analysing Changes in Equilibrium

 - When some event shifts one of the curves, the equilibrium in the market changes. The analysis of such a change is called *comparative statics* because it involves two static situations - an old and a new equilibrium
 - Steps:
   - Which curve is shifted
   - Which direction is the curve shifted
   - Analyse how the shift affects the Equ. Price and Quantity using S & D diagram

#### Change in demand

 - Weather gets hotter - ice cream becomes more in demand
 - Buyers are more willing to pay - demand curve shifts to the right
 - Supply, and thereby the supply curve, still remain unchanged (Quantity supplied rises, i.e., movement upwards along the curve)
 - Increase in demand - raise in Equ. Price and Quantity

- Shift **in** the supply curve - “change in supply,”
- Shift **in** the demand curve - “change in demand.”
- Movement **along** a fixed supply curve - “change in the quantity supplied,”
- Movement **along** a fixed demand curve - “change in the quantity demanded.”

## Conclusion & Summary

 - Supply and demand are the forces that make market economies work
 - They determine the quantity of each good produced and the price it is sold
 - An event or policy indirectly affects the economy by directly affecting the S & D
 - S & D determine prices, prices determine allocation of economy's scarce resources
 - Market economies are guided by an invisible hand. Prices are the *baton* the invisible hand uses

## Key Concepts

 - Market: A group of buyers and sellers of a particular good or service
 - Competitive Market: A market in which there are many buyers and many sellers so that each has a negligible impact on the market price
 - Quantity Demanded: The amount of a good buyers are willing and able to purchase
 - Law of Demand: The claim that, other things equal, the quantity demanded of a good falls when the price of the good rises
 - Normal Good: A good for which, other things equal, an increase in income leads to an increase in demand
 - Inferior Good: A good for which, other things equal, an increase in income leads to a decrease in demand. Eg: Taking the bus vs taking a cab
 - Substitues: Two goods for which an increase in the price of one leads to an increase in the demand for the other. Eg:
   - Ice Cream and FroYo
   - Burgers and Hot Dogs
 - Complements: Two goods for which an increase in the price of one leads to a decrease in the demand for the other. Eg:
   - Ice Cream and Hot Fudge
   - Automobiles and Gasoline
   - Computers and Softwares
 - Demand Schedule: A table that shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded
 - Demand Curve: A graph of the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded
 - *Ceteris Paribus*: A Latin phrase, translated as “other things being equal,” used as a reminder that all variables other than the ones being studied are assumed to be constant
 - Quantity Supplied: The amount of a good that sellers are willing and able to sell
 - Law of Supply: The claim that, other things equal, the quantity supplied of a good rises when the price of the good rises
 - Supply Schedule: A table that shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied
 - Supply Curve: A table that shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied
 - Equilibrium: A situation in which supply and demand have been brought into balance
 - Equilibrium Price: The price that balances supply and demand
 - Equilibrium Quantity: The quantity supplied and the quantity demanded when the price has adjusted to balance supply and demand
 - Surplus: A situation in which quantity supplied > quantity demanded
 - Shortage: A situation in which quantity demanded > quantity supplied
 - Law of Supply and Demand: The claim that the price of any good adjusts to bring the supply and demand for that good into balance
