# HS 101: Chapter 3: Interdependence And The Gains From Trade

> HS 101: Economics

## Modern Economy

 - When one person is better at producing every good, should they trade? **YES**. Benefits may be unequal but still both sides will benefit

### Production Possibilities

 - PPF can be bowed out or a straight line

## The Principle of Comparative Advantage

 - When one person is best at producing both (or every) goods, comparison is done on two different metrics

### Absolute Advantage

 - To compare productivity of people / firms / nations
 - Producer that requires small quantity of inputs $\rightarrow$ has absolute advantage in producing that good

### Opportunity Cost and Comparative Advantage

 - Another way to compare costs - using opportunity costs. This method of description is called comparative advantage and reflects relative opportunity cost
 - PPF comes into play
 - Producer with smaller opportunity cost $\rightarrow$ has comparative advantage in producing that good
 - Impossible for the same person to have a comparative advantage in both goods because opportunity cost of one good is inverse of the other

### Comparative Advantage and Trade

 - Each person produces their specialisation, i.e., has a comparative advantage in $\rightarrow$ total production in economy rises $\rightarrow$ rise in economic pie $\rightarrow$ everyone is better off
 - When two people have different opportunity costs $\rightarrow$ each can benefit from trade
 - Trade can benefit everyone in society because it allows people to specialize in activities in which they have a comparative advantage

## Applications of Comparative Advantage

 - Explains interpendence - which is so prevalent in the modern world
 - **Common Barrier To Free Trade** - taxes on import of goods

### Necessity to Trade with Other Countries

 - Extrapolating trade and specialisation among individuals to between countries
 - Trade allows all countries to achieve greater prosperity

## Conclusion & Summary

 - Benefits of living in an interdependent economy
 - Interdependence and trade are desirable. Everyone can enjoy greater quantity and variety of G & S
 - Gains from trade is based on comparative advantage, **not** absolute advantage
 - Economists advocate for free trade among countries

## Key Concepts

 - Absolute Advantage: The comparison among producers of a good according to their productivity
 - Comparative Advantage: The comparison among producers of a good according to their opportunity cost
 - Imports: Goods produced abroad and sold domestically
 - Exports: Goods produced domestically and sold abroad
