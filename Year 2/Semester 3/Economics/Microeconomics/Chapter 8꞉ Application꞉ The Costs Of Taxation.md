# HS 101: Chapter 8: Application: The Costs Of Taxation

> HS 101: Economics

 - Effect of taxes on welfare, the economic well-being of the market participants
 - **Cost of taxes to buyers and sellers > revenue raised by the gov**

## Deadweight Loss Of Taxation

 - B&S share the burden regardless of how the tax is levied
 - Deadweight loss can be represented as a wedge without showing a shift in the demand or supply curve
 - $$Tax\ Revenue = Size\ of\ Tax\ (T) \times Quantity\ Sold(Q)$$
 - Tax Wedge: Q falls bellow Equ. Q
   - A tax on a good causes the size of the market for the good to shrink

### Effects of a Tax on Market Participants

 - Measure of economic welfare of gov ==  Tax Revenue
   - Benefit doesn't accrue to the gov but on whom the tax revenue is spent
 - **Welfare without a tax:**
   - $$CS_i = A + B + C$$
   - $$PS_i = D + E + F$$
   - $$TS_i = A + B + C + D + E + F$$
 - **Welfare with a tax**
   - $$CS_f = A$$
   - $$PS_f = F$$
   - $$TS_f = A + F$$
   - $$TR_f = B + D$$
   - $$Deadweight\ Loss = C + E$$

#### Changes in welfare

 - "People Respond to Incentives"
 - B&S respond to the (negative) incentives (to buy/sell more), the size of the market shrinks below its optimum
 - Taxes distort incentives, and cause markets to allocate resources inefficiently

### Deadweight Losses and Gains from Trade

 - When TS < DL
 - When the tax raises the price to buyers to $P_B$ and lowers the price to sellers to $P_S$, the **marginal buyers and sellers leave the market**, so the quantity sold falls from $Q_1$ to $Q_2$
   - The deadweight loss is the surplus lost because the tax discourages these mutually advantageous trades

## Determinants of Deadweight Loss

 - Price Elasticities of S&D determine DL
 - A tax has a deadweight loss because it induces buyers and sellers to change their behavior. 
   - The tax raises the price paid by buyers, so they consume less. 
   - At the same time, the tax lowers the price received by sellers, so they produce less
   - The size of the market shrinks below the optimum. 
 - The elasticities of supply and demand measure how much sellers and buyers respond to the changes in the price and, therefore, determine how much the tax distorts the market outcome. 
 - Hence, the **greater the elasticities of supply and demand, the greater the deadweight loss of a tax**

### Case Study: The Deadweight Loss Debate

 - Economists who argue that labor taxes are not very distorting believe that labor supply is fairly inelastic. Most people, they claim, would work full-time regardless of the wage. If so, the labor supply curve is almost vertical, and a tax on labor has a small deadweight loss
 - Economists who argue that labor taxes are highly distorting believe that labor supply is more elastic. They admit that some groups of workers may supply their labor inelastically but claim that many other groups respond more to incentives
 ◆ Overtime. The higher the wage, the more hours they choose to work
 ◆ Second earners. Compare the benefits of being at home (including savings on the cost of child care) with the wages they could earn
 ◆ Retirement, the wage determines their incentive to work part-time
 ◆ Some people consider engaging in illegal economic activity, such as the **drug trade**, or working at jobs that pay *“under the table”* to evade taxes. Economists call this the *underground economy*. In deciding whether to work in the underground economy or at a legitimate job, these potential criminals compare what they can earn by breaking the law with the wage they can earn legally
 -  Labor taxes encourage workers to work fewer hours, second earners to stay at home, the elderly to retire early, and the unscrupulous to enter the underground economy

#### Tax on land

 - The burden of a tax falls more heavily on the side of the market that is less elastic
 - A tax on land takes this principle to an extreme. Because the elasticity of supply is zero, the landowners bear the entire burden of the tax
 - Because supply is perfectly inelastic, a tax on land does not alter the market allocation. There is no deadweight loss, and the government’s tax revenue exactly equals the loss of the landowners
 - Looks attractive in theory, it is not as straightforward in practice as it may appear
   - For a tax on land not to distort economic incentives, it must be a tax on raw land. Yet the value of land often comes from improvements, such as clearing trees, providing sewers, and building roads. Unlike the supply of raw land, the supply of improvements has an elasticity greater than zero
   - If a land tax were imposed on improvements, it would distort incentives. Landowners would respond by devoting fewer resources to improving their land

## Deadweight Loss And Tax Revenue As Taxes Vary
  
 - $$DL \alpha (TR)^2$$
 - Initially, size of tax increases - TR increases - DL gets larger
 - Eventually, TR falls because the higher tax drastically reduces the market size

### Case Study: Laffer Curve and Supply-Side Economics

 - *Supply-side* economics
 - Laffer curve suggested that US in the 1980s was on the downward sloping side of the TR curve. Turned out to be wrong
   - Rich tax payers actually paid more. But overall TR decreased after decreasing size of tax

## Conclusion & Summary

 - Taxes reduce CS and PS
 - "Markets are usually a good way to organise market activity"

## Key Concepts

 - Deadweight Loss: The fall in total surplus that results from a market distortion, such as a tax
