# HS 101: Chapter 5: Elasticity And Its Applications

> HS 101: Economics



## The Elasticity Of Demand

 - Quantitative study

### Price Elasticity of Demand and its Determinants

 - Law of demand states that - fall in price $\rightarrow$ raises demand
 - Elastic, if the QD responds substantially to changes in the price
   - P(y) vs Q(x) - m = 0
   - Elasticity > 1
 - Inelastic, if the QD responds only slightly to changes in the price
   - P(y) vs Q(x) - m = $\infty$
   - Elasticity < 1
 - -$\infty$ < m < 0
 - Unit Elasticity = 1
 - Determining factors: Economic, social and psychological - general rules listed below

#### Necessities versus luxuries

 - Luxury - Elastic. Eg: Cruise trip
 - Necessity - Inelastic. Eg: Visiting the doctor, salt
 - Depends not only on the intrinsic properties of the good, but also on the preferences of the buyer

#### Availability of close substitutes

 - Have substitutes - Elastic. Eg: Coca-Cola / Pepsi
 - No close substitute - Inelastic. Eg: Eggs

#### Definition of the market

 - Narrowly defined market - Elastic. Eg: Ice-cream / other desserts
 - Broadly defined market - Ineslatic. Eg: Food

#### Time horizon

 - More time - Elastic
 - Less time - Inelastic
 - Eg: Gasoline. Prices rise, slight fall in demand. Over time, switch from private to public transportation, buy more fuel-efficient cars
 - PRICES FLUCTUATE MORE IN A SMALLER TIME FRAME RIGHT??
   - They fluctuate more, but the QD is still quite *sticky*

### Computing the PED

 - $$PED = \frac{\% \ change\ in\ QD}{\% \ change\ in\ price}$$
 - Generally reported in terms of *absolute value*
 - Larger price elasticity $\Rightarrow$ greater responsiveness of QD to price

### Midpoint Method

 - Above formula is not commutative
 - $$PED_{Midpoint Method} = \frac{\frac{(Q_{2} - Q_{1})}{Q_{avg}}}{\frac{(P_{2} - P_{1})}{P_{avg}}}$$
 - Better formula

### Variety of Demand Curves

 - The flatter is the demand curve that passes through a given point, the greater is the PED
 - The steeper is the demand curve, the smaller is the PED

### Total Revenue and PED

 - Area under demand curve
 - Inelastic - increase in price raises total revenue
 - Elastic - increase in price reduces total revenue
 - Unit elastic demand - change in price does not affect total revenue

### Elasticity and Total Revenue along a Linear Demand Curve

 - Slope (of a line) maybe a constant, elasticity may not

### Case Study: Pricing Admission to a Museum

 - Check PED

### Other Demand Elasticities

#### Income elasticity of demand

 - $$Income\ ED = \frac{\% \ change\ in\ QD}{\% \ change\ in\ income}$$
 - \+ for *normal goods*
 - \- for *inferior goods*

#### Cross-price elasticity of demand

 - $$Cross-PED = \frac{\% \ change\ in\ QD_1}{\% \ change\ in\ price_2}$$
 - \+ for substitutes
 - \- for complements

## The Elasticity Of Supply

### Price Elasticity of Supply and its Determinants

 - Law of supply states that higher prices raise the QS
 - Inelastic eg: Beach-front houses
   - Perfectly inelastic, m = $\infty$
   - Elasticity = $\frac{1}{m}$ < 1
 - Elastic eg: Most manufactured goods
   - Perfectly elastic, m = 0
   - Elasticity > 1

### Computing the PES

 - $$PES = \frac{\% \ change\ in\ QS}{\% \ change\ in\ price}$$

### Variety of Supply Curves

 - Low present QS - high elasticity
 - High present QS - tends to inelastic

## Applications Of Supply, Demand And Elasticity

### Good News for Farming; Bad New for Farmers

 - New variety of crop
 - Higher yields per farm
 - Price of wheat falls (as there is a lot of wheat)
 - Demand is quite inelastic and there is no good substitute
 - Farmers eventually earn less $P \times Q$

### OPEC Fails to Keep the Price of Oil High

 - Disruptive industry
 - Price of oil rose from 1972 to 1981. OPEC countries jointly accomplished their goal of increasing the price (by reducing the supply)
 - Price steadily declines from 1982 to 1985
 - Cooperation between the countries broke down and oil price crashed in 1986
 - P1990 = P1970
 - D & S behave differently in short (relatively inelastic) and long run
   - Supply is inelastic because the quantity of known oil reserves and the capacity for oil extraction cannot be changed quickly
   - Demand is inelastic because buying habits do not respond immediately to changes in price
 - OPEC's coordinated reduction was less profitable in the long run
 - Oil price has never reached the heights of 1981 again

### Drug Interdiction and its Effect on Drug-Related Crimes

 - Government increases expenditure in the war against drugs
   - Expected to reduce drug use
   - But direct impact is on sellers and not buyers
 - Cost of selling drugs increases, QS decreases
   - Demand stays the same
   - Supply curve shifts to the left, Eq P & Q decreases, drug use decreases
 - Demand for drug is inelastic (atleast in the short run) as breaking addiction is hard
   - Prices have increased, so more crimes are committed to get the money to obtain drugs

## Conclusion & Summary

 - S & D tools can be applied in many different kinds of markets

## Key Concepts

 - Elasticity: A measure of the responsiveness of quantity demanded or supplied to one of its determinants
 - Price Elasticity of Demand: A measure of how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in the price of that good, computed as the % change in QD divided by the % change in price
 - Total Revenue: The amount paid by buyers and received by sellers of a good $$Price\ of\ good\ \times \ quantity\ sold$$
 - Income Elasticity of Demand: A measure of how much the QD of a good responds to a change in consumersâ€™ income, computed as the % change in QD divided by the % change in income
 - Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand: A measure of how much the QD of one good responds to a change in the price of another good, computed as the % change in QD of the first good divided by the % change in the price of the second good
 - Price Elasticity of Supply: A measure of how much the QS of a good responds to a change in the price of that good, computed as the % change in QS divided by the % change in price
