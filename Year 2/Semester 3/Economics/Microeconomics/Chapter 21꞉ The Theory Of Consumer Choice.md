# HS 101: Chapter 21: The Theory Of Consumer Choice

> HS 101: Economics

 *  "People face tradeoffs"
 - Decisions behind the demand curve
 - Buys more of one good, can only afford less of another

## Budget Constraint: Consumer Affordables

 - Spending is constrained by income
 - "Opportunity cost is what you give up to get it"
 - Combination of goods the consumer can afford given an income and prices of goods

## Preferences: Consumer Wants

### Representing Preferences with Indifference Curves

 - If two *bundles* suit a consumer's taste equally, the consumer is said to be **indifferent** between the two bundles
 - Preferences graphically - indifference curve
 - Points on a higher indifference curve are preferred to points on a lower indifference curve (because consumers prefer more goods)
 - Marginal Rate of Substitution shows the rate at which the consumer is willing to trade one good for the other
   - Depends on the amount of the good already being consumed
 - **Indifference curves are not straight lines**
   - MRS is not the same at all points
 - Indifference Curve $\simeq$ Utility Curve

### Properties of Indifference Curves

 ◆ Higher indifference curves are preferred to lower ones
   - Consumers usually prefer more of something to less of it
 ◆ Indifference curves are downward sloping
   - The slope of an indifference curve reflects the rate at which the consumer is willing to substitute one good for the other. In most cases, the consumer likes both goods. Therefore, if the quantity of one good is reduced, the quantity of the other good must increase in order for the consumer to be equally happy
 ◆ Indifference curves do not cross
   - Otherwise, this will contradict our assumption that the consumer always prefers more of both goods to less
 ◆ Indifference curves are bowed inward
   - The slope of an indifference curve is the MRS — the rate at which the consumer is willing to trade off one good for the other. MRS usually depends on the amount of each good the consumer is currently consuming
   - In particular, because people are more willing to trade away goods that they have in abundance and less willing to trade away goods of which they have little
   - Thus, the bowed shape of the indifference curve reflects the consumer’s greater willingness to give up a good that they already have in large quantity

### Two Extremes Examples of Indifference Curves

 - When the goods are easy to substitute for each other, the indifference curves are less bowed; when the goods are hard to substitute, the indifference curves are very bowed

#### Perfect Substitutes

 - MRS is fixed, indifference curves are straight lines

#### Perfect Complements

 - Indifference curves are at right angles

## Optimisation: Consumer Chooses

### Consumer's Optimal Choices

 - Optimum: Point at which the highest indifference curve and the budget constraint touch
   - MRS == Relative price of the goods
   - Indifference curve is tangent to the budget constraint
 - The **relative price** is the rate at which the market is willing to trade one good for the other, whereas the **MRS** is the rate at which the consumer is willing to trade one good for the other
 - At consumer optimal, market prices of different goods reflect the value that consumers place on those goods

### Effect of ____ on Consumer's Choices

#### Changes in Income

 - Increase in income, leads to a parallel shift in the budget constraint
   - Higher indifference curve can be picked leading to greater consumption of both goods
 - Both goods are assumed to be normal goods under this analysis
 - If one of the goods is an inferior good, then its consumption will fall when incomes rises

#### Changes in Prices

 - Slope of budget constraint changes
 - Price of a good decreases, its consumption increases

##### Income and Substitution Effects

 - The income effect is the change in consumption that results from the movement to a higher indifference curve. The substitution effect is the change in consumption that results from being at a point on an indifference curve with a different marginal rate of substitution
   - Income and substitution effects work in opposite directions
   - Change in consumption of price-unchanged good is ambiguous
 - The change from point A to point B represents a **pure change in MRS** without any change in the consumer’s welfare. Similarly, the change from point B to point C represents a **pure change in welfare** without any change in MRS
   - The movement from A to B shows the substitution effect, and the movement from B to C shows the income effect. (A to B, slide along same indifference curve. B to C, shift to higher indifference curve)

### Deriving the Demand Curve

 - Demand curve reflects consumption decisions (QD of a good for any given price)
 - Arises naturally from the theory of consumer choices

## Applications

 - Household decisionmaking

### Do All Demand Curves Slope Downwards?

 - Shady math
 - Giffen good
   - Price of an inferior good increases; Income effect exceeds Substitution effect
   - Demand curve sloped upward

### Effect of Wages on Labour Supply

 - If the substitution effect is greater than the income effect, labourer works more. If the income effect is greater than the substitution effect, they work less
   - The opportunity cost of taking leisure could have incresed, then the individual would substitute consumption for leisure and work more
   - On the other hand, the individual might use the higher wage rate to *buy* more leisure and decide to work less
 - The labor supply curve, therefore, could be either upward or downward sloping

### Case Study: Income Effects on Labour Supply

 - Don't win the lottery. You will give up your job

#### Historical Trends

 - Definitely

#### Lottery Winners

 - Don't

#### The Carnegie Conjecture

 - Don't inherit either

### Effect of Interest Rate on Household Saving

 - Substitution effect. When the interest rate rises, consumption when old becomes less costly relative to consumption when young. Therefore, the substitution effect induces a person to consume more when old and less when young - substitution effect induces them to save more
 - Income effect. When the interest rate rises, they move to a higher indifference curve. They are now better off than they were. As long as consumption in both periods consists of normal goods, they tend to want to use this increase in well-being to enjoy higher consumption in both periods - income effect induces them to save less
 - Disappointing in terms of economic policy as it *could* go either way

### Do the Poor prefer Cash or In-Kind Transfers?

 -  If an in-kind transfer of a good forces the recipient to consume more of the good than they would on their own, then the recipient prefers the cash transfer
 - If the in-kind transfer does not force the recipient to consume more of the good than they would on their own, then the cash and in-kind transfer have exactly the same effect on the consumption and welfare of the recipient.

## Conclusion & Summary

 - When the price of a good falls, the impact on the consumer’s choices can be broken down into an income effect and a substitution effect
   - The income effect is the change in consumption that arises because a lower price makes the consumer better off
   - The substitution effect is the change in consumption that arises because a price change encourages greater consumption of the good that has become relatively cheaper
   - The income effect is reflected in the movement from a lower to a higher indifference curve, whereas the substitution effect is reflected by a movement along an indifference curve to a point with a different slope

## Key Concepts

 - Budget Constraint: The limit on the consumption bundles that a consumer can afford
 - Indifference Curve: A curve that shows consumption bundles that give the consumer the same level of satisfaction
 - Marginal Rate of Substitution: The rate at which a consumer is willing to trade one good for another
 - Perfect Substitutes: Two goods with straight-line indifference curves
 - Perfect Complements: Two goods with right-angle indifference curves
 - Normal Good: A good for which an increase in income raises the quantity demanded
 - Inferior Good: A good for which an increase in income reduces the quantity demanded
 - Income Effect: The change in consumption that results when a price change moves the consumer to a higher or lower indifference curve
 - Substitution Effect: The change in consumption that results when a price change moves the consumer along a given indifference curve to a point with a new marginal rate of substitution
 - Giffen Good: A good for which an increase in the price raises the quantity demanded
