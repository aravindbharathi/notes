# The Costs Of Production

 - Law of supply summarises firm's production decisions
 - Decisions behind a supply curve
 - *Industrial Organisation*: the study of how firms’ decisions regarding prices and quantities depend on the market conditions they face
   -  How does the difference in the number of firms affect the prices in markets and the efficiency of the market outcomes?
 - Firm's costs are a key determinant of its prodution and pricing decisions

## Costs

### Profit

 - To make money and <u>maximise profits</u> are valid reasons to start a business and is the goal of firms
$$Profit = Total\ Revenue - Total\ Cost$$
 - Easy to measure revenue, hard to measure cost

### Opportunity Costs

 - "Opportunity Costs"
 - Cost of production includes opportunity costs
   - Explicit costs and implicit costs tracked by economist
   - Only explicit costs tracked by accountants

## Production and Costs

### Production Function

 - The relationship between quantity of inputs used to make a good and the quantity of output of that good
 - "Rational People Think at the Margin"
 - Diminishing Marginal Product $\Rightarrow$ Production Function Saturates
   - The property whereby the marginal product of an input declines as the quantity of the input increases

### Total Cost Curve

 - Curve eventually blows up (Looks like the inverse of production function)
 - Note that:
   - Production function: y-axis = Output Quantity
   - Total Cost Curve: x-axis = Output Quantity

## Measures of Cost

$$Total\ Cost = Fixed\ Cost + Variable\ Cost$$
 - **Marginal Cost** eventually rises with the quantity of output produced
   - Reflects the property of diminishing marginal product
 - **Average Total Cost** is *U-Shaped*
 - **Average Fixed Cost** always declines as output rises
 - **Average Variable Cost** rises as output increases because of dmp
 - **Efficient Scale:** The quantity of output that minimizes average total cost
   - The marginal-cost curve <u>crosses the average-total-cost curve</u> here
 - *Whenever marginal cost is less than average total cost, average total cost is falling*
 - *Whenever marginal cost is greater than average total cost, average total cost is rising*

## Costs in the short and long run

 - Fixed costs in the short run can be variable in the long run
 - Long run ATC is a much flatter *U-Shape*
 - All short run curves lie on or above long run curves
   - Greater flexibility in the long run

## Key Concepts

 - Explicit costs Costs that require an outlay of money by the firm
 - Implicit costs: Costs that do not require an outlay of money by the firm
$$Accounting\ Profit = Total\ Revenue - Explicit\ Cost$$
$$Economic\ Profit = Total\ Revenue - Explicit\ Cost - Implicit\ Cost$$
 - Fixed Costs: Costs that do not vary with the quantity of output produced
 - Variable Costs: Costs that do vary with the quantity of output produced
$$Average\ Total\ Cost = \frac{Total\ Cost}{Quantity}$$
$$Marginal\ Cost = \frac{\Delta Total\ Cost}{\Delta Quantity}$$
   - Marginal Cost: The increase in total cost that arises from an extra unit of production
 - Economies of Scale: Long-run ATC falls as the quantity of output increases 
   - Higher production levels allow specialization among workers
 - Diseconomies of Scale: Long-run ATC rises as the quantity of output increases
   - Coordination problems that are inherent in any large organization
 - Constant Returns to Scale: Long-run ATC stays the same as the quantity of output changes

## Summary

 - Firm's production process $\Leftrightarrow$ Its total costs
 - Typical firm's cost curves
 - Short run and long run costs

# Firms In Competitive Markets

## Competitive Market

 - A market with **many** buyers and sellers trading **identical products** so that each buyer and seller is a *price taker*
 - Third Characterstic of perfectly competitive market ◆ Firms can **freely** enter or exit the market
   - Much of the analysis of competitive firms does not rely on the assumption of free entry and exit because this condition is not necessary for firms to be price takers
   - It shapes the long run outcome in competitive markets
 - In competitive markets, for all firms, **average and marginal revenue** equals the price of the good

## Profit Maximisation
## **Single Firm's**

 - Goal of a firm
 - How it does it (decisions) $\Leftrightarrow$ supply curve
 - As long as **marginal revenue exceeds marginal cost**, increasing the quantity produced raises profit
   - At the **profit-maximizing level** of output, marginal revenue and marginal cost are exactly equal
 - "Rational People Think at the Margin"

### Supply Decision

 - **Marginal Cost Curve** is upward sloping
 - **ATC** is *U-Shaped*
 - Marginal Cost Curve crossed ATC at the minimum of ATC
 - **Horizontal line** at the market price (P) because the firm is a price taker: The price of the firm’s output is the same regardless of the quantity that the firm decides to produce
 - Marginal-cost curve determines the quantity of the good the firm is willing to supply at any price $\Rightarrow$ it is the competitive firm’s supply curve

### Decision to Shutdown

 - Firms cannot avoid their fixed costs in the short run but can do so in the long run
   - A firm that shuts down temporarily still has to pay its fixed costs **(*Sunk Cost*)**
     - A cost that has already been committed and cannot be recovered
     - Kind of opposite to opportunity cost
   - A firm that exits the market saves both its fixed and its variable costs
$$Shut\ Down\ if\ TR < VC \Rightarrow P < AVC$$
 The firm shuts down if the revenue that it would get from producing is less than its variable costs of production
 - The competitive firm’s short-run supply curve is the portion of its marginal-cost curve that **lies above AVC**

### Decision to Enter or Exit

$$Exit\ if\ TR < TC \Rightarrow P < ATC$$
$$Enter\ if\ TR > TC \Rightarrow P > ATC$$
 -  The competitive firm’s long-run supply curve is the portion of its marginal cost curve that **lies above ATC**

### Measuring Profit

$$Profit = TR - TC = (P - ATC) \times Q$$
 - Note that $P = AR = MR$

## Supply Curve

 - Short run - fixed number of firms
 - Long run - number of firms adjust to changing market conditions
 - As long as **price is above AVC**, each firm’s marginal-cost curve is its **supply curve**
 - If firms already in the market are profitable, then new firms will have an incentive to enter the market. This entry will expand the number of firms, increase the QS, and drive down prices and profits
 - Conversely, if firms in the market are making losses, then some existing firms will exit the market. Their exit will reduce the number of firms, decrease the QS, and drive up prices and profits
 - At the end of this process of entry and exit (dynamic equilibrium stabilises), firms that remain in the market must be making zero economic profit
   - The process of entry and exit **ends only when price and ATC are driven to equality**

#### Implications

 - Competitive firms produce so that price equals marginal cost
 - Free entry and exit forces price to equal ATC
 $$\Rightarrow Marginal\ Cost = ATC = \textbf{P}$$
 - Note that Marginal Cost Curve crosses ATC at the **minimum of ATC**
 - Long-run equilibrium of a competitive market with free entry and exit must have firms operating at their **efficient scale**
   -  New firms have no incentive to enter the market, and existing firms have no incentive to leave the market
 - Even if profits are driven to zero, revenue compensates the opportunity costs

### Upward Slope of Supply Curve

 - Resources used in production may be available only in limited quantities
 - Different firms may have different costs
   - Those with lower costs are more likely to enter than those with higher costs
   - In this case, the price in the market reflects the average total cost of the marginal firm — the firm that would exit the market if the price were any lower. This firm earns zero profit, but firms with lower costs earn positive profit
 - Long-run supply curve is typically more elastic than the short-run supply
curve
 - **Marginal Cost Curve is the Supply Curve**

## Key Concepts

$$Average\ Revenue = \frac{Total\ Revenue}{Quantity\ Sold}$$
 - Marginal Revenue: Change in total revenue from an additional unit sold
 - Shutdown: Short-run decision not to produce anything during a specific period of time because of current market conditions
 - Exit: Long-run decision to leave the market

# Extras

 - Production $\rightarrow$ f(input) = output
$$Marginal\ Revenue\ Product\ (MRP) = Marginal\ Product\ (MP) \times Marginal\ Revenue\ (MR)$$
 - Firm Profits when $MRP \geq Marginal\ Resource\ Cost$
   - Maximum attained at equality
 - Isoquants :: Budget Constraint
 - Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution (MRTS) :: Indifference Curve
 - Fixed cost - Constant
 - Variable cost - Increasing
 - Paretio Efficiency :: Just Efficiency
   - One person's loss will lead to another's gain
 - Positive Economics - Can't correct inequalities and inefficiencies
   - They are corrected through normative questions through political debates
