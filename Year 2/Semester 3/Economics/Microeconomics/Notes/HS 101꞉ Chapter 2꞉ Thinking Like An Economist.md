# HS 101: Chapter 2: Thinking Like An Economist

> HS 101: Economics

## The Economist As A Scientist

 - Applying methods of science
 - Making assumptions and creating models
 - Supply, demand, elasticity, comparative advantage, consumer surplus, deadweight loss
 - Theories, case studies, examples in the news

### The Scientific Method

 - Devise theories $\rightarrow$ collect data $\rightarrow$ analyse data $\rightarrow$ verify or refute theories
 - Investigate history
   - Also evaluate present theories if experiments are not possible

### The Role of Assumptions

 - Make them to simplify things
 - Short-run effects, assume prices don't change much (or even completely fixed)
 - Long-run effects, same assumptions don't apply

### Economic Models

 - Omit details to see what is important
 - A need for models to explain:
   - The economy is organised
   - How participants in the economy interact with one another

### The Circular-Flow Diagram

 - Simple model of economy to fit the pieces of economy together
 - ![Circular-Flow Diagram](circularflowdiagram.jpg)
 - Types of Decisionmakers:
   - Households
   - Firms
 - Factors of Production(FoP) / inputs - labour, land, capital
 - Fully Exhaustive
 - Interactions take place in markets
 - G & S and money flow in opposite directions
 - Realistic circular-flow model will include:
   - Role of government
   - International trade

### The Production Possibilities Frontier

 - Simple math model
 - ![PPF](ppf.jpg)
 - A tradeoff faced by society. Opportunity cost is also seen
 - Inside the curve $\rightarrow$ inefficient
   - Due to unemployment
 - On the curve $\rightarrow$ efficient
 - Outside the curve $\rightarrow$ infeasible
 - PPF is bowed outward
   - This means that the opportunity cost of cars in terms of computers depends on how much of each good the economy is producing. When the economy is using most of its resources to make cars, the PPF is quite *steep* 
   - Because even workers and machines best suited to making computers are being used to make cars, the economy gets a substantial increase in the number of computers for each car it gives up. By contrast, when the economy is using most of its resources to make computers, the production possibilities frontier is quite *flat*
   - In this case, the resources best suited to making computers are already in the computer industry, and each car the economy gives up yields only a small increase in the number of computers
 - Tradeoff can change over time, like when technology advances, *shifting* the PPF outward

### Microeconomics and Macroeconomics

 - They are closely intertwined
 - Decisions of individuals $\rightarrow$ changes in country's economy
   - Analysing implications of tax cuts on production of G & S
 - Needn't always know the building blocks to analyse the large scheme of things

## The Economist As A Policy Advisor

### Positive vs Normative Analysis

 - Language is important
 - Scientist vs Policy Advisor
 - Need to take both into account, answers aren't always straightforward - as it is rooted in "People Face Tradeoffs"

## Why Economists Disagree

 - Disagreement over the validity of alternative positive theories on how the world works
 - Differences in values $\therefore$ different normative views about what a policy should try to accomplish

### Differences in Scientific Judgement (Positive Statements)

 - Economists disagree about whether the government should levy taxes based on a householdâ€™s **income** or its **consumption** (spending). Advocates of the switch believe that the change would encourage households to save more, because income that is saved would not be taxed. Higher saving would lead to more rapid growth in productivity and living standards
 - Advocates of the current income tax believe that household saving would not respond much to a change in the tax laws
 - These two groups of economists hold different normative views about the tax system because they have different positive views about the responsiveness of saving to tax incentives

### Differences in Values (Normative Statements)

 - Peter has income of $50,000 and is taxed $5,000, or 10 percent of his income. Paul has income of $10,000 and is taxed $2,000, or 20 percent of his income
 - Is this policy fair? If not, who pays too much and who pays too little?

### Perception vs Reality

 - Disagreement between economic advisors and politicians / policymakers

## Conclusion & Summary

 - Ideas and methods in economics
 - Explain the world - scientists. Improve the world - policy advisor

## Key Concepts

 - Circular-Flow Diagram: A visual model of the economy that shows how cash flows through markets among households and firms
 - Production Possibilities Frontier: A graph that shows the combinations of output that the economy can possibly produce given the available FoP and the available production technology
 - Microeconomics: The study of how households and firms make decisions and how they
interact in markets
   - Eg: Rent control on housing, foreign competition in industry, effects of compulsory school attendance on worker's earnings.
 - Macroeconomics: The study of forces and trends of economy-wide phenomena, including inflation, unemployment, and economic growth
   - Eg: Borrowing by government, economy's rate of unemployment, policies to raise national living standards
 - Positive Statements: Claims that attempt to describe the world as it **is**
   - Confirm or refute such statement by examining data
 - Normative Statements: Claims that attempt to prescribe how the world **ought to be**
   - Scrutinising involves views on values - ethics, religion, political philosophies - and facts
