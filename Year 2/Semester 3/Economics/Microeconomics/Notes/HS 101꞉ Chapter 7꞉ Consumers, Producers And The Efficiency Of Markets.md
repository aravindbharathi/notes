# HS 101: Chapter 7: Consumers, Producers And The Efficiency Of Markets

> HS 101: Economics

 - Welfare Economics
 - "Markets are usually a good way to organise economic activity" 
   - Explained more fully by welfare economics
 - Make normative judgements

## Consumer Surplus

### Willingness to Pay

 - Buyer
   - Eager to buy at a price < their WTP
   - Refuse to buy at a price > their WTP
   - Indifferent about buying at a price = their WTP
 $$Consumer\ Surplus\ =\ WTP\ -\ Amount\ Paid$$
   - Measures the benefits to buyers of participating in a market
   - Amount that buyers WTP - amount they actually pay for it, measures the benefit that buyers receive from a good *as the buyers themselves perceive it*
 $$Total\ Consumer\ Surplus\ =\ \Sigma Individual\ Consumer\ Surplus$$

### Measuring Consumer Surplus using Demand Curve

 - Closely related
 - At any price, the demand curve shows the WTP of the marginal buyer
 - The area below the demand curve and above the price measures the consumer surplus in a market

### Lower Price Raises Consumer Surplus

 - Buyers always want to pay less for the goods they buy
 - Price falls - existing consumers now pay less and new consumers enter the market at the lower price

### What Consumer Surples Measures

 - Make normative judgements about the desirability of market outcomes
 - Good measure of economic well-being if policymakers want to respect the preferences of buyers
 - Ignore said preferences of drug addicts
 - Consumers are the best judges of how much benefit they receive from the goods they buy

## Producer Surplus

 - Similar to analysis of buyer's welfare

### Cost and Willingness to Sell

 - Cost == Opportunity Cost, ie, Cost of production
   - Cost is the lowest price seller will accept
 - Price == Amount Seller is Paid
 - $$Producer\ Surplus = Price - Cost$$

### Measuring Producer Surplus using Supply Curve

 - Closely Related
 - At any quantity, price given by SC shows the cost of marginal seller
 - Area between price and SC = PS

### Higher Price Raises Producer Surplus

 - Sellers always want to be paid more for the goods they sell
 - Price raises - existing sellers now receive more and new sellers enter the market at the higher price
 - PS is used to measure the well-being of sellers in much the same way as CS is used to measure the wellbeing of buyers

## Market Efficiency

 -  Because PS and CS measures of economic welfare are so similar, it is natural to use them together
   - They are the basic tools that economists use to study the welfare of buyers and sellers in a market

### Benevolent Social Planner (Well Intentioned Dictator)

 - $$Total\ Surplus = CS + PS = Value\ to\ Buyers\ (WTP) - Cost\ to\ Sellers$$
 - TS is a measure of society's economic well-being
 - Efficiency - Maximising TS
   - Ineffient when a good is not being produced by the seller with the lowest cost
     - Move production from high-cost to low-cost producer to raise TS
   - Also inefficient when the good is not being consumed by the buyer who value it most highly
     - Move consumption from low valuation to high valuation buyer to raise TS
 - Equity - Fairness of distribution of well-being among various buyers and sellers
 - Efficiency - Size of the pie - Positive Judgement - Objective Goal
 - Equity - Pie sliced fairly - Normative Judgement - Political Philosophy
 - We will concentrate on efficiency
 - *Laissez-faire*: Allow them to do

### Market Equilibrium

 - Allocation of resources in free market == Allocation of resources at market equilibrium == SC and DC intersect == Highest Economic Well-being
 1. Free markets allocate the supply of goods to the buyers who value them most highly, as measured by their WTP
 2. Free markets allocate the demand for goods to the sellers who can produce them at least cost
 3. Free markets produce the quantity of goods that maximizes the sum of CS and PS
 -  At quantities below the equilibrium, the value to buyers exceeds the cost to sellers. In this region, increasing the quantity raises TS, and it continues to do so until the quantity reaches the equilibrium level. Beyond the equilibrium quantity, however, the value to buyers is less than the cost to sellers. Producing more than the equilibrium quantity would, therefore, lower TS
 -  Equilibrium outcome is an efficient allocation of resources

## Conclusion & Summary

 - Economists advocate free markets as the best way to organise market activity
 - Basic tools of welfare economics - CS and PS
 - Forces of S&D allocate resources efficiently
 1. Analysis assumed that markets are **perfectly competitive**
   - Market Power / Monopoly
 2. Analysis assumed that the outcome in a market matters only to the buyers and sellers **in that market**
   - Externalities / Side Effects
 - Market Failure: the inability of some unregulated markets to allocate resources efficiently
   - Public policy can potentially remedy the problem and increase economic efficiency
   - Microeconomists study when market failure is likely and policies to correct them
 - Policymakers are concerned with efficiency and equity 

## Key Concepts

 - Welfare Economics: The study of how the allocation of resources affects economic well-being
 - Willingness to Pay: The maximum amount that a buyer will pay for a good
 - Consumer Surplus: A buyer's willingness to pay minus the amount the buyer actually pays
 - Cost: The value of everything a seller must give up to produce a good
 - Produce Surplus: The amount a seller is paid for a good minus the seller's cost
 - Efficiency: The property of a resource allocation of maximising the total surplus received by all members of society
 - Equity: The fairness of the distribution of well-being among the members of society
