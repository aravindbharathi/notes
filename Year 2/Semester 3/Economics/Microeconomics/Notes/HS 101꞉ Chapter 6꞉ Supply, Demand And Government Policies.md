# HS 101: Chapter 6: Supply, Demand And Government Policies

> HS 101: Economics

 - Policymaking

## Controls On Prices

 - Groups lobby the government to pass laws that alter the market outcome by directly controlling the prices
 - Buyers and sellers conflict
 - Price ceiling. Eg: Rent Control
 - Price floor. Eg: Minimum wage laws

### How Price Ceilings Affect Market Outcomes

 - Non binding ceiling - PC > Equ. Price. Has no effect
 - Binding ceiling - PC < Equ. Price 
   - Becomes a *binding constraint* and causes shortage
   - A mechanism for rationing develops (undesirable) as number of potential buyers are large
   - Motive was to benefit buyers but not all buyers benefit from the policy
 - Rationing mechanism in a free, competitive market is efficient and impersonal

### Case Study: Lines at the Gas Pump

 - 1973, oil prices increased, supply of gasoline decreased (oil is an input for gasoline)
 - Additionally, government regulations limited the price petrol bunk companies could charge for selling gasoline
 - Equ. Price exceeded PC causing shortage of gasoline for consumers

### Case Study: Rent Control

 - In the short run, supply is inelastic and demand is also relatively inelastic. PC causes only a small shortage
   - Primary effect is to reduce rents
 - In the long run, both supply and demand are elastic causing large shortage
 - "People respond to incentives" *aka bribes*
 - At the end of the day, tenants get lower rents and lower quality houses

### How Price Floors Affect Market Outcomes

 - Non binding floor - PF < Equ. Price. Has no effect
 - Binding floor - PF > Equ. Price
   - Becomes a *binding constraint* and causes surplus

### Case Study: Minimum Wage

 - Worked determine the supply of labour while firms determine the demand
 - If minimum wage > equ. price, it causes unemployment
   - Incomes of those with jobs raises (High skill and experience)
   - Those who can't find jobs gets poorer (low skilled like teenage labour)

### Evaluating Price Controls

 - "Markets are usually a good way to organise economic activity" 
   - Economist usually oppose PC and PF as they believe it is the decision of millions of seller and consumer decisions
   - Policies obscure the *invisible hand*
 - "Governments can sometimes improve market outcomes"
   - Targetted groups could end up worse as others take advantage of policies
   - Instead help the poor directly - tax and other subsidies
 
## Taxes

 - To raise revenues for public projects - roads, school, national defense
 - How they affect the economy
 - Who bears the burden - Tax incidence, by applying the tools of S&D

### How Taxes on Buyers Affect Market Outcomes

 - Follow steps for analysing S&D *(Ch 4)*
   - Supply curve unaffected, demand curve shifts left

 ◆ Taxes discourage market activity. When a good is taxed, the quantity of the
good sold is smaller in the new equilibrium.
 ◆ Buyers and sellers share the burden of taxes. In the new equilibrium, buyers
pay more for the good, and sellers receive less

### How Taxes on Sellers Affect Market Outcomes

 - Demand curve doesn't change, supply curve shifts left
 - Taxes on buyers and taxes on sellers are equivalent
   - The tax places a wedge between the price that buyers pay and the price that sellers receive. The wedge between the buyers’ price and the sellers’ price is the same, regardless of whether the tax is levied on buyers or sellers. In either case, the wedge shifts the relative position of the supply and demand curves. 
   - In the new equilibrium, buyers and sellers share the burden of the tax. The only difference between taxes on buyers and taxes on sellers is who sends the money to the government

### Case Study: Distributing the burdern of a Payroll Tax

 - Payroll tax is merely a tax on a good, where the good is labor and the price is the wage. The key feature of the payroll tax is that it places a wedge between the wage that firms pay and the wage that workers receive
 - When a payroll tax is enacted, the wage received by workers falls, and that paid by firms rises. The division of the tax burden between workers and firms has nothing to do with the legislated division: 
   - The division of the burden is not necessarily 50-50, and the same outcome would prevail if the law levied the entire tax on workers or on firms.
 - Basic lesson of tax incidence - Lawmakers can decide whether a tax comes from the buyer’s or seller's pocket, but they cannot legislate the true burden of a tax
   - It depends on the forces of supply and demand.

### Elasticity and Tax Incidence

 -  A tax burden falls more heavily on the side of the market that is less elastic
   - The elasticity measures the willingness of buyers or sellers to leave the market when conditions become unfavorable
   - A small elasticity of demand means that buyers do not have good alternatives to consuming this particular good. A small elasticity of supply means that sellers do not have good alternatives to producing this particular good
   - When the good is taxed, the side of the market with fewer good alternatives cannot easily leave the market and must, therefore, bear more of the burden of the tax.

### Case Study: Luxury Tax

 - Yachts, private aeroplanes, furs, jewelry, expensive cars
 - A billionaire can choose not to buy a yacht and could take a vacation instead
 - Supply of yachts is inelastic in the short run

## Conclusion & Summary

 - Effects of government price ceilings and price floors
 - How the burden of a tax is split
 - Price control is enacted when market price is unfair to buyers or sellers
 - Taxes influence market outcomes and raise revenues for public purposes
 - Laws in an economy: (and saw how they interact)
   - Laws of S&D
   - Laws enacted by government
 - When analyzing government policies, S&D are the first and most useful tools of analysis
 - When the government levies a tax on a good, the equ. quantity of the good falls
   - Tax on a market shrinks its size

## Key Concepts

 - Price Ceiling: A legal maximum on the price at which a good can be sold
 - Price Floor: A legal minimum on the price at which a good can be sold
 - Tax Incidence: The study of who bears the burden of taxation
