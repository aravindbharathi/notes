# HS 101: Chapter 1: Ten Principles Of Economics

> HS 101: Economics

## Individual Decisionmaking - How People Make Decisions

### People Face Tradeoffs

 - Guns vs Butter
 - Clean Environment vs High Levels of Pollution
   - Laws that require firms to reduce pollution raise the cost of producing goods and services. Higher costs - smaller profits - pay lower wages - charge higher prices
 - Efficiency vs Equity
   - Welfare system or unemployment insurance - promotes equity - reduces efficiency
 - Acknowledge life's tradeoffs - Understand the options - Make good decisions
 - Tradeoffs among alternative goals

### The Cost of Something is What You Give Up To Get It

 - Oppotunity Cost

### Rational People Think at the Margin

 - Thinking in the grey ares, not black and white
 - Marginal Changes
 - Compare marginal benefits and marginal costs
 - Take action iff marginal benefit > marginal cost

### People Respond to Incentives

 - Must consider direct and indirect effects
 - Incentives alter people's behaviour

## How People Interact

### Trade Can Make Everyone Better Off

 - Trade is win-win
 - Without trade, you need to be self sufficient
 - Trade allows specialisation
 - One party *might* benefit more than the other

### Markets are <u>Usually</u> a Good Way to Organise Economic Activity

 - Communist countries worked on the premise that central planners in the government were in the best position to guide economic activity. These planners decided what goods and services were produced, how much was produced, and who produced and consumed these goods and services. The theory behind central planning was that only the government could organize economic activity in a way that promoted economic well-being for the country as a whole
 - Market Economy
 - **Adam Smith:** *An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, 1776*
 > Households and firms interacting in markets act as if they are guided by an “invisible hand” that leads them to desirable market outcomes
   - Prices are the instrument with which the invisible hand directs economic activity
   - Prices reflect both the value of a good to society and the cost to society of making the good
   -  Because households and firms look at prices when deciding what to buy and sell, they unknowingly take into account the social benefits and costs of their actions. As a result, prices guide these individual decisionmakers to reach outcomes that, in many cases, maximize the welfare of society as a whole
 - Corollary:: When the government prevents prices from adjusting naturally to supply and demand, it impedes the invisible hand’s ability to coordinate the millions of households and firms that make up the economy
   -  Taxes distort prices and thus the decisions of households and firm
   - Central planners failed because they tried to run the economy with one hand tied behind their backs - the invisible hand of the marketplace

### Governments can <u>Sometimes</u> Improve Market Outcomes

 - When invisible hand fails - market fails
 - Causes of market failure
   - Externality
   - Market Power
 -  A market economy rewards people according to their ability to produce things that other people are willing to pay for
 - The government *can* improve on markets outcomes at times does not mean that it always *will*
   - Public policy is made by a political process that is far from perfect
   - Sometimes policies are designed simply to reward the politically powerful
   - Sometimes they are made by well-intentioned leaders who are not fully informed

## How The Economy As A Whole Works

### A Country's Standard of Living Depends on its Ability to Produce Goods and Services

 - Productivity $\alpha$ Standard of Living
 - Growth of productivity $\alpha$ Growth of average income
 - Raise productivity by
   - Educating workers
   - Make tools and access best technology
 - High Investment Today $\rightarrow$ High Productivity in Future

### Prices Rise when the Government Prints too much Money

 - Inflation
 - High inflation imposes various costs on society, keeping inflation at a low level is a goal of economic policymakers around the world
 - Cause of Inflation - growth in quantity of money

### Society Faces a Short-Run Tradeoff between Inflation and Unemployment

 - Reducing inflation - temporary rise in unemployment (Phillips Curve)
 - ![Phillips Curve](phillipscurve.jpg)
 - Arises because prices are slow to adjust
   - Restaurants may take time to produce new menus
   - Prices are sticky in short-run
 - Government reduces quantity of money - amount people spend reduces - prices stil stuck high - reduces quantity of goods produced - lower sales - firms forced to lay off
 - Powerful tool, should be used judiciously

## Conclusion & Summary

 - Economics is about the allocation of scarce resources
 -  A society must decide what jobs will be done and who will do them. Also allocate the output of goods and services that they produce
 - Goal of economics - judge when a government policy is justifiable to promote efficiency or equity and when it is not

## Key Concepts 

 - Scarcity: The limites nature of society's resources
   - Cannot produce all the goods and services people wish to have
 - Economics: The study of how society manages its scarce resources
   -  In most societies, resources are allocated not by a single central planner but through the **combined actions** of millions of households and firms. Economists therefore study how people make decisions: how much they work, what they buy, how much they save, and how they invest their savings
   -  Analyze forces and trends that affect the economy as a whole - average income, unemployment, and inflation
 - Efficiency: The property of society getting the most it can from its scarce resources
 - Equity: The property of distributing economics prosperity fairly among the members of society
   - Efficiency refers to the size of the economic pie, and Equity refers to how the pie is divided
   - Government policies - two goals conflict
 - Opportunity Cost: Whatever must be given up to obtain some item
 - Marginal Charges: Small incremental adjustments to a plan of action
   - Marginal Charges are adjustments around the edges of what you are doing
 - Market Economy: An economy that allocates resources through the decentralized decisions of many firms and households as they interact in markets for goods and services
   - The decisions of a central planner are replaced by the decisions of millions of firms and households. Firms - whom to hire and what to make. Households - which firms to work for and what to buy with their incomes. These firms and households interact in the marketplace, where prices and self-interest guide their decisions
 - Market Failure: A situation in which a market left on its own fails to allocate resources efficiently
 - Externality: The impact of one person’s actions on the well-being of a bystander
 - Market Power: The ability of a single economic actor (or small group of actors) to have a substantial influence on market prices 
   - Monopoly - No competition
 - Productivity: The amount of goods and services produced from each hour of a worker’s time
 - Inflation: An increase in the overall level of prices in the economy
 - Phillips Curve: A curve that shows the short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment
   - Remains controversial but most accept the idea

## Questions

1. A rational decision maker takes an action only if the __________ exceeds the marginal costs.
  - marginal benefits
2. Economists use the phrase "There is no such thing as a free lunch," to illustrate the principle that
