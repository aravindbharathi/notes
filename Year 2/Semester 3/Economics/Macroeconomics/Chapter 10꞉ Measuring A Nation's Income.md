# Mankiw HS 101: Chapter 10: Measuring A Nation's Income

> HS 101: Economics

 - Monitoring the performance of the overall economy
   - Through data that reflects the economic changes
   - Gross Domestic Product = GDP

Macroeconomic Statistics:
 - Total income of everyone in an economy = GDP
 - The rate at which average prices are rising = Inflation
 - The % of labour force that is out of work = Employment
 - Total Spending at stores = Retail Sale
 - Imbalance of trade between a country and the rest of the world = Trade Deficit

Goal of Macroeconomics: Explain the economic changes that affect many households, firms and markets at once

 - Average Income
 - Rapid rise of prices and price stability
 - Expansion and contraction of production and employment
 - Promoting rapid growth in income. Maintaining low inflation and stable employment

 - Economy as a whole is a collection of many firms and households interacting in many markets

## The Economy's Income and Expenditure

 - GDP measures:
   - Total income of everyone in the economy
   - Total expenditure on the economy's output of goods and services
 - *For an economy as a whole, income = expenditure*
   - Every transaction has two parties - buyers and sellers
   - Circular-Flow Diagram
     - In the economy, money continuously flows between households and firms
  $$GDP = \sum Expenditure_{Households} = \sum Income_{Firms}$$
 - Households don't spend all of their incomes
 - Households don't buy all the goods that are sold (governments might buy)

## Measuring GDP

 - **GDP is the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time**
   - "GDP is the market value" - Market prices measure the amount people are willing to pay for different goods, they reflect the value of those goods. If the price of an apple is twice the price of an orange, then an apple contributes twice as much to GDP as does an orange
   - "of all" - GDP tries to be comprehensive (illegal sales are excluded). For people living in their 'own home', the government estimates the rental value of their place
     - Vegetables you buy at the grocery store are part of GDP; vegetables you grow in your garden are not
     - When a person working **for** another person marries each other, GDP falls
   - "final" - Final good sold might have had some intermediate products of manufacturing. But only the final goods are included in GDP (otherwise it will incorrectly be double-counted)
     - If the intermediate good is also sold parallely, the such sold quantity will be included in the GDP
   - "goods and services" - music album recorded CD = good; live concert = service
   - "produced" - G&S currently produced are included in the GDP. Not old/ previous year products
   - "within a country" - GDP measures the value of production within the geographical confines of a country regardless of the nationality of the producer
   - "in a given period of time" - value of production that takes place within a specific interval of time
     - "At an annual rate" = GDP(in a quarter) $\times$ 4
     - Seasonal adjustments applied

 - Other measures of income:
   - Gross National Product (GNP) - It differs from GDP by including income that a country's citizens earn abroad and excluding income that foreigners earn here
   - Net National Product (NNP) - $NNP = GNP - Depreciation\ Cost$
     - Depreciation is the wear and tear on the economy’s stock of equipment and structures, such as trucks rusting and lightbulbs burning out
     - "Consumption of fixed capital"
   - National Income (NI) - $NI = NNP - indirect\ business\ taxes + business\ subsidies$
   - Personal Income
   - Disposable personal income is the income that households and noncorporate businesses have left after satisfying all their obligations to the government. $DPI = PI - personal\ taxes$
 - GDP grows $\Rightarrow$ other measurements grow

## Components Of GDP

$$Y = C + I + G + NX$$
where Y=GDP, C=Consumption, I=Investment, G=Government purchases, NX=Net Exports
 
 - **Consumption:** Spending by households on G&S with the exception of purchases of new housing
   - This is the largest component
 - **Investment:** Spending on capital equipment, inventories and structures, including household purchases of new housing
 - **Government Purchases:** Spending on G&S by governments
 - **Net Exports:** Value of G&S produced domestically and sold abroad (exports) minus the value of G&S produced abroad and sold domestically (imports)
 $$NX = exports - imports$$
 - Transfer Payments like pensions are not counted as part of GDP

## Real Versus Nominal GDP

 - If GDP rises from one year to the next:
   - Either the economy is producing a larger output of G&S
   - Or G&S are being sold at higher prices
 - These two changes need to be separated
 $$GDP\ Deflator = \frac{Nominal\ GDP}{Real\ GDP}\times 100$$
 - Real GDP is the GDP calculated against the prices in a (preselected) base year (base year is a year in the past)
   - Value of goods produced this year valued at the prices that prevailed in the base year
   - Shows how the economy's overall **production** of G&S has changed over time
 - Production of G&S valued at current prices is called Nominal GDP
 - Changes in real GDP reflect only changes in the amounts being produced
   - GDP generally refers to Real GDP

### GDP Deflator

 - Measures the current level of prices relative to the level of prices in the base year

 - Two consecutive quarters of falling real GDP $\Rightarrow$ Recession
   - Recessions are associated not only with lower incomes but also with other forms of economic distress: rising unemployment, falling profits, increased bankruptcies, and so on
 - Macroeconomics is aimed at explaining the long-run growth and short-run fluctuations in real GDP

## GDP And Economic Well-Being

 - GDP does not take account of our intelligence, integrity, courage, wisdom, or devotion to country, but all of these laudable attributes are easier to foster when people are less concerned about being able to afford the material necessities of life
 - The (physical) downsizing of output, meant that products were easier and hence less costly to move, and most especially across national borders
 - GDP does not directly measure those things that make life worthwhile, but it does measure our ability to obtain the inputs into a worthwhile life
 - GDP omits the value of goods and services produced at home
   - Volunteer work also contributes to the well-being of those in society, but GDP does not reflect these contributions
 - GDP reflects a factory's production, but not the harm that it inflicts on the environment
   - GDP per person tells us what happens to the average person, but behind the average lies a large variety of personal experiences
 - GDP leads to a higher standard of living and quality of life
 - It is a good measure but not perfect

## Conclusion

 - Measuring GDP

## Key Concepts

 - Microeconomics: The study of how households and firms make decisions and how they interact in markets
 - Macroeconomics: The study of economy-wide phenomena, including inflation, unemployment, and economic growth
 - Nominal GDP: The production of goods and services valued at current prices
 - Real GDP: The production of goods and services valued at constant prices

## Extra

 - Potential Output (or Natural GDP): Highest level of sustainable real GDP (over the long term)
 - Net Factor Income from Abroad (NFIA):$GNP - GDP = NFIA$
   - $NFIA = Factor Income received from abroad - Factor Income paid abroad
   - GDP = output based on demographic location
   - GNP = output based on ownership
 - High level and rapid growth of output
 - Stable moderate inflation rate
   - Zero inflation is often welcomed by average consumers. They will benefit from cheaper prices and the feeling of more disposable income. This ‘feel good’ factor may encourage stronger confidence – investment, spending and growth. In the current climate, low inflation could be a  blessing in disguise.
   - However, there is also a real danger that if we get stuck in a period of ultra-low inflation/deflation, then all the problems of deflation will become more prominent and start to hold back normal economic growth.

 - Stock variables = Total money supply, total bank deposits, Inventory, capital stock
   - At a specific point in time
 - Flow variables = C,I,G,NX
   - Change in money supply is a flow quantity
   - Over a period of time
 - Stock = Inflows - Outflows
 - Aggregate D&S eq. give real GDP
 1. Product Approach or value added approach
 2. Income Approach
 3. Expenditure Approach
