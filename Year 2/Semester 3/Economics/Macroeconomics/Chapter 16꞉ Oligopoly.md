# HS 101: Chapter 16: Oligopoly

> HS 101: Economics

 - Competition and monopoly are extreme forms of market structure
 - **Oligopoly: A market structure in which only a few sellers offer similar or identical products**
   - The actions of one seller, can impact the profits of other sellers
   - Oligopolistic firms are interdependent in a way that competitive firms aren't
 - **Monopolistic Competition: A market structure in which many firms sell products that are similar but not identical**

##

 - Two types of imperfect competition:
   - Oligopoly. Eg: Middle-East and Oil
   - Monopolistic Competition. Eg: Computer Games, Movies
 - Types of Market Structure (Industrial Organisation). Number of firms?
   - One $\rightarrow$ Monopoly
   - Few $\rightarrow$ Oligopoly
   - Many $\rightarrow$ Type of Products?
     - Differentiated $\rightarrow$ Monopolistic Competition
     - Identical $\rightarrow$ Perfect Competition

##

 - A key feature of oligopoly $\rightarrow$ tension between cooperation and self-interest
   - Best-off cooperating and acting like a monopolist
   - But each firm only cares about their own profit

 - Oligopoly with two members $\rightarrow$ duopoly
 - **Collusion: An agreement among firms in a market about quantities to produce or prices to charge**
 - **Cartel: A group of firms acting in unison**
   - In effect, it is a monopoly
 - Antitrust laws prevent such explicit agreements

### Oligopoly Equilibrium

 - If the duopolists individually pursue their own self-interest when deciding how much to produce, they produce a total quantity greater than the monopoly quantity, charge a price lower than the monopoly price, and earn total profit less than the monopoly profit (thereby driving each other down till they reach Nash Equilibrium)
 - **Nash Equilibrium: A situation in which economic actors interacting with one another each choose their best strategy given the strategies that all the other actors have chosen**
 - **Self-interest does not drive the market all the way to the competitive outcome**
 - Monopoly Price > Oligopoly Price > Competitive Market Price = Marginal Price

### Size of an Oligopoly and its effects on Market Outcome

 - Number of sellers increases:
   - Ability to form a cartel decreases
   - Eq. price decreases (approaches $MC$)
   - Eq. quantity increases (approaches socially efficient level)

 ◆ The output effect: Because price is above marginal cost, selling 1 more gallon of water at the going price will raise profit.
 ◆ The price effect: Raising production will increase the total amount sold, which will lower the price of water and lower the profit on all the other gallons sold.
 - If output effect is larger than price effect, production will be raised
 - The larger the number of sellers, the less concerned each seller is about its own impact on the market price. That is, as the oligopoly grows in size, the magnitude of the price effect falls. When the oligopoly grows very large, the price effect disappears altogether, leaving only the output effect
   - In this extreme case, each firm in the oligopoly increases production as long as price is above marginal cost (Large oligopoly == perfectly competitive market)

 - Mexico is reuniting the OPEC cartel

## Game Theory And The Economics Of Cooperation

 - **Game Theory: The study of how people behave in strategic situations**
   - A situation in which each person, when deciding what actions to take, must consider how others might respond to that action
   - Useful for understanding the behaviour of oligopolies
 - Cooperation is desirable but difficult
 - Prisoner's dilemma: A particular “game” between two captured prisoners that illustrates why cooperation is difficult to maintain even when it is mutually beneficial
   - Arms race, advertising, common resources
   - Third-party **enforcing** such cooperation can help in these situations
 - Dominant Strategy: A strategy that is best for a player in a game regardless of the strategies chosen by the other players
 - Cooperation is difficult to maintain because it is individually irrational
 - By contrast, in the case of oligopolists trying to maintain monopoly profits, lack of cooperation is desirable from the standpoint of society as a whole
   - When oligopolists fail to cooperate, the quantity they produce is closer to this optimal level
 - *The invisible hand guides markets to allocate resources efficiently only when markets are competitive, and markets are competitive only when firms in the market fail to cooperate with one another*
 - In a game of repeated prisoners’ dilemma, the two players may well be able to reach the cooperative outcome
 > The winner turned out to be a simple strategy called *tit-for-tat*

## Public Policy Towards Oligopolies

 - "*Government can sometimes improve market outcomes*"
 - Policymakers should try to induce firms in an oligopoly to compete rather than cooperate

### Restraint of Trade and Antitrust Laws

 - "Attempt to monopolise" is illegal
 - Policymakers regulate the behavior of oligopolists through the antitrust laws

### Controversies over Antitrust Policies

 - Price-fixing among competing firms agreements should be illegal
   - It clearly reduces economic welfare

 - **Resale Price Maintenance**
   - *Business practices that appear to reduce competition may in fact have legitimate purposes*
 - **Predatory Pricing**: Driving out other competitors to gain monopoly by slashing prices
   - The prey can counter-attack and make the predator suffer
 - **Tying**: Forcing to buy combos instead of standalone products
   - A mechanism for expanding market power (by exploiting *WTP* for different products)

## Conclusion & Summary

 - Oligopolies would like to act like monopolies, but self-interest drives them closer to competition
   - Thus, oligopolies can end up looking either more like monopolies or more like competitive markets, depending on the number of firms in the oligopoly and how cooperative the firms are
