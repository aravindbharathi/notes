# HS 101: Chapter 3: Income and Spending

> HS 101: Economics

 - Fluctuation of output (around its potential level)
   - Growth is uneven
 - Spending $\leftrightarrow$ output and income
 - *Keynesian* model of income determination
 - Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply
   - AS is flat in this chapter
 - Equilibrium Output

## Aggregate Demand and Equilibrium Output

 - **AD is the total amount of goods demanded in the economy**
   - Generally, AD depends on the level of income in the economy
   - For now, we shall assume that AD is constant and independent of the level of income
 $$AD = C + I + G + NX$$
 - Y always moves towards Equilibrium with constant AD
   - AD vs Y graph
   - Y == Level of Output
 - AD is the planned spending by households on consumption, by firms on investment goods, by government on its purchases of g&s and net exports
 - Remember, in actuality, and subsequent discussions in this chapter itself, **AD is NOT a constant** and is itself affected by the level of output because consumption demand depends on the level of income

### Equilibrium Output

 - **Output is at its equilibrium level when the quantity of output produced is equal to the quantity demanded**
   $$AD = C + I + G + NX = Y$$
   - An equilibrium situation is one where no forces are causing to change
   - If output exceeds demand, firms would be unable to sell all they produce and would cut their output
   - If output were lesser than eq. firms would be running down their inventories and therefore increase output
   - At eq. there's no tendency for the level of output to change

### Equilibrium Output and National Income Identity

 - AD is the amount of goods people want to buy
   - Investment and Consumption (in the National Income Accounts) are the amounts of the goods **actually** bought
     - **I**, in particular, includes involuntary and unintended inventory changes
   - Actual AD (in an accounting context) vs Planned (intended) AD (in an economic context)
   $$Actual\ AD = C + I + G + NX = Actual\ Y$$
     - But in National Income Accounts, addition (of excess production) to inventories count as investment (though it is not planned)
     - **Unplanned Investment** == Disinvestment == $IU$
  $$IU = Y - AD$$
     - Negative implies unplanned reductions in inventory
 - Only at eq. level of income, Planned AD = Actual AD = Actual Y

 1. AD determines the eq. level of output
 2. At eq., unintended changes in inventories are zero (Everyone is purchasing the amounts they want to purchase)
 3. Non-eq. output will move to eq. level

 - Eq $\Rightarrow$ Actual Spending = Planned Spending(AD) = Y

## Consumption Function and AD

 - Determinant of AD $\rightarrow$ Consumption Demand
   - For simplicity, let $G = NX = 0$
 - CD increases with increase in income (this is called consumption function)

### Consumption Function

 $$C = \bar{C} + cY_D$$
 where $\bar{C}$(y-intercept) > 0, 0 < c(slope of CF) < 1, $Y_D$ **disposable income**
 - $\bar{C}$ is the level of consumption when income is zero
 - When $G = NX = 0$, $Y_D = Y$
 - When income is zero, an individual has to sell their assets like bonds, stocks or their house to buy goods
 - $Y_D$ is the amount of income they have available to spend
 - $c$ is the **Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC)**
   - The increase in consumption per unit increase in income

### Consumption and Saving

 - Income is either spent or saved
   - Income that is not consumed is saved
 $$Saving,S = Y - C$$
 Budget Constraint
 - **Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS)** $s = (1-c)$ > 0 
 - Saving increases as income rises

### Planned Investment and AD

 - Determinant of Invt Spending (Invt Fn)
 - Let planned invt spending be a **constant** $\bar{I}$
 - As $G = NX = 0$, $AD = \bar{C} + cY_D + \bar{I} = \bar{A} + cY_D$
   - $\bar{A} is the autonomous spending
 - $\Rightarrow$ AD depends on the level of income 

### Eq. Income and Output

 $$Eq.\ Output, Y_0 = \frac{1}{1 - c}\bar{A}$$

### Saving and Invt

 - At eq., planned invt($\bar{I}$) == saving($S$)
   - Characterstic of eq. level of income 
   - Above eq., saving > planned invt
 $$Y - C = Saving$$
 $$AD - C = Planned\ Invt$$

## Multiplier

 $$Multiplier, \alpha = \frac{1}{1-c}$$
 - Amount by which eq. output changes when autonomous AD increases by one unit
 $$Y_0 = \alpha\bar{A}$$
 - Larger MPC $\rightarrow$ a larger fraction of an additional dollar of income will be consumed $\rightarrow$ Larger Multiplier
 - The multiplier suggests that output changes when autonomous spending (including invt) changes

 1. An increase in autonomous spending raises the eq. level of income
 2. The increase in income is a multiple of the increase in autonomous spending
 3. Larger MPC $\rightarrow$ larger multiplier

## Government Sector

 - Government purchases (G)
 - Taxes (Tx) and Transfers (Tr)
 $$Y_D = Y + Tr - Tx$$
 - $G$ and $Tr$ are constants
 $$G = \bar{G},\ \ Tr = \bar{Tr},\ \ Tx = tY$$
 where $t$ is the *proportional* income tax
 - MPC increases $\rightarrow$ Output increases
 - A **proportional** Inc. Tax increases $\rightarrow$ Output decreases
 $$AD = (\bar{C} + \bar{I} + \bar{G} + c\bar{Tr}) + c(1-t)Y$$
 AD now consists of a term which is a multiple of c
 $$\Rightarrow AD = \bar{A} + c(1-t)Y$$

 - $Y_0 = AD$
 $$Y_0 = \frac{\bar{A}}{1-c(1-t)}$$

#### Effects on Multiplier

 $$\alpha_G = \frac{1}{1-c(1-t)}$$
 Denote the multiplier in presence of income taxes

#### Income Tax as Automatic Stabilizers

 - An automatic stabilizer is any *mechanism* in the economy that **reduces the amount** by which $Y$ changes **in response to a change** in $\bar{A}$
 - Business cycles are casued by shifts in $\bar{A}$ and investment is an especially volatile component
 - *Unemployment benefits* is another automatic stabilizer
   - They enable the unemployed to continue consuming even if they do not have a job. This means that demand falls less when someone becomes unemployed

 $$\Delta Y_0 = \frac{\Delta \bar{A}}{1 - c(1-t)}$$

 - A reduction of income tax rate $t$ leaves the consumer with a larger proportion of every dollar of income earned $\rightarrow$ larger $Y$

 - Therefore, fiscal policy can be used to stabilize the economy
   - When economy is in recession, taxes should be cut or G should be increased

## Budget Surplus

 $$BS = Tx - G - Tr = tY - \bar{G} - \bar{Tr}$$
 Budget Surplus is the excess of the government's revenue - taxes (Tx) -, over its total expenditure - purchases of g&s (G) and transfer payments (Tr)
 - Size of BS depends on fiscal policy variables Tx, G and Tr
 - A negative BS is a budget deficit
   - When the government spends more than it receives
 - Budget deficits (generally) occur during recessions
   - In practice, Tr increses during recessions but for the sake of simplicity we will consider Tr as an autonomous model
 
 $$\Delta BS = \Delta \bar{Tx - G - Tr}$$
 - An increase in tax rate increases BS despite the reduction in income (that it causes)

 - *Balanced budget multiplier* is the amount by which all the three variables should change for BS to remain constant. What is the change in $Y$? $\Delta Y = \Delta \bar{G}$

## Full-Employment Budget Surplus

 - Increases in taxes reduce the level of income
   - Increase in G and Tr increase the level of income
   - Increse in taxes, however, add to BS while increases in G reduces BS

 - BS is a convenient and simple measure of the effects of fiscal policies
   - When BS < 0 $\rightarrow$ fiscal policy is expansion oriented (expansionary) towards increasing GNP
 - Defect of BS, BS can change because of changes in autonomous private spending
   - An increase in budget deficit does not necessarily mean the gov has implemented policy to increase the level of income

 - $Y^*$: Full-employment level of income / potential output
 $$BS^* = tY^* - \bar{G} - \bar{Tr}$$
 where $BS^*$ is full-employment BS / cyclically adjusted surplus / high-employment surplus / standardized employment surplus / structural surplus
 $$BS^* - BS = t(Y^* - Y)$$
 When u'ment is high / economy is in recession, the difference is large

 1. There is no certainty to the measurement of full-employment level of output
   - Various assumptions about the level of u'ment that corresponds to full-employment are possible
   - Generally 5-5.5% u'ment rate is considered full-employment
 2. $BS^*$ is not a perfect measure of the thrust of fiscal policy (using a single number)
   - A change in spending with a matching increase in taxes (leaving the deficit unchanged) will raise income
   - Expectations about future fiscal policy can affect current income
   - It is merely a guide to the dir of fiscal policy

## Summary

 - **All the results derived in this chapter assume that the prices are fixed**. In actuality, price adjustment dampens the output response to price changes
