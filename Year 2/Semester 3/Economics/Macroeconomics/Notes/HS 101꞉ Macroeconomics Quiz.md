# HS 101: Macroeconomics Quiz

## U'ment Rate

 - Actively looking for a job, but hasn't found one
 - Labour force = Employed + Unemployed
 - U'ment rate = 100 * unemployed / labour force
 - Labour Force participation rate = 100 * labour force / adult population
 - U'ment rate can reflect the state of the business cycle in the economy
   - When output falls $\rightarrow$ labour demand falls and involuntary u'ment rate rises

## Stock and Flow

 - Stock variables, accumulated At a given point in time:
   - Total money supply, total bank deposits, inventory, capital stock
   - Govt debt
 - Flow variables, Over a period of time:
   - Consumption, Investment, National Income, Output
   - Change in money
   - Budget Deficit
 - Stock = Inflows - Outflows

## Aggregate Demand

 - Total amount that different sectors **willingly** spend on g&s in a given period
 $$Y = C + I + G + NX$$
 $NX = (X - M)$
 - Depends on monetary and fiscal policies, and other forces

## Aggregate Supply

 - Total quantity of g&s that different sectors are **willing** to produce and sell during a given period
 - Depends on price level and costs, potential output, and capital, labour and technology
 - **Potential Output**: Maximum Sustainable output that an economy can produce

## AD + AS

 - Causes
   - Output (Y or real GDP)
   - U'ment rate
   - Prices and inflation
   - Foreign trade
 - Eq. point $\Rightarrow$ AS = AD
 - Business cycles occur **about** potential output
 - Growth in potential output depends on long-run economic performance

## National Income Accounting

 - Types:
   - Product Approach (Value added approach): Amount of output produced excluding intermediate outputs
   - Income Approach: Total income generated in the economy
   - Expenditure Approach: Amount of spending by the ultimate purchasers of output
 - All three give identical measurements (income approach is most popular for tertiary sector, product approach for primary and secondary sectors)
 - Remember, income equals expenditure
 - GDP is a measure of national income accounting

##

 $$GNP = GDP + NFIA$$
 $$GDP\ deflator = 100 \times \frac{Nominal\ GDP}{Real\ GDP}$$
 $$NDP = GDP - Depreciation \Leftrightarrow NNP = GNP - Depreciation$$
 $$Net\ Business\ Savings = Corporate\ Profits - Corporate\ Profit\ Tax - Dividends$$
 Net Business Savings is also called Retained Earnings
 $$Y_D = GNP + (Tr - Tx) - undistributed\ profits$$
 $$NNP_{FC} + Indirect\ Taxes - Subsidies = NNP_{MP}$$
 National income at factor cost (FC)
 National income at market prices (MP)
 - National income is better related to GNP than GDP as the former includes earnings by Indian citizens abroad and excludes foreigners earnings in India
   - Bad debts come under other in business sector
 $$NNP - (Indirect\ Taxes + Other) = NI$$
 Indirect taxes includes both sales and excise taxes 
 $$Indirect\ Taxes - Subsidies = Net\ Indirect\ Taxes$$
 $$NNP - Net\ Indirect\ Taxes = NI$$

 $$S - I = G + Tx - Tr + NX$$
 Government expenditure is possible using $G + Tr - Tx$
 Ultimately, savings == intersection is the stable eq.
 $$\frac{1}{MPS} = \frac{dY}{dI} = savings\ multiplier$$
 $$M^s = mRM$$
 Trend line for m is upward
 $$RM\ or\ H = Currency + Reserves$$
 $$M^s = Currency + Deposits$$
 - Problems arise when excess reserves (= actual - required) becomes NPA and bad debts

##

 $$CPI = \frac{Price\ of\ basket\ in\ given\ year}{Price\ of\ basket\ in\ base\ year} \times 100$$
 $$Inflation = \frac{CPI_{year\ 2} - CPI_{year\ 1}}{CPI_{year\ 1}} \times 100$$
