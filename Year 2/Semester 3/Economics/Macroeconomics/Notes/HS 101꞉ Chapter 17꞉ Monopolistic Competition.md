# HS 101: Chapter 17: Monopolistic Competition

> HS 101: Economics

 - Some features of monopoly, some features of competition
 - Books, movies, computer games, restaurants

 ◆ Many sellers: There are many firms competing for the same group of customers
 ◆ Product differentiation: Each firm produces a product that is at least slightly different from those of other firms. Thus, rather than being a price taker, each firm faces a downward-sloping demand curve
 ◆ Free entry: Firms can enter (or exit) the market without restriction. Thus, the number of firms in the market adjusts until economic profits are driven to zero

 - The role of brand names?
 - Oligopoly and Monopolistic Competition are **different**

## Competition With Differentiated Products

 - Decisions facing an individual firm
 - In the long-run, as firms enter and exit the industry...
 - Eq. in Monopolistic Competition
 - Is the outcome desirable from a society's standpoint?

### Monopolistically Competitive Firms in the Short Run

 - Each firm in a monocomp market has a downward sloping demand curve (as it offers different products from other firms). Produce quantity where $MR = MC$
   - **But**, this can either be a profit maximizing quantity ($P > ATC$) or a loss minimizing quantity ($P < ATC$)
 - In the short run, monocomp and monopoly are similar

### Long Run Equilibrium

 - When firms are making profits, new firms have an incentive to enter the market $\rightarrow$ increases the number of products from which customers can choose $\rightarrow$ reduces the demand faced by each firm
   - Profit encourages entry $\rightarrow$ shifts the demand curve to the left $\rightarrow$ price falls $\rightarrow$ declining profits
   - Conversely, when firms are making losses, firms exit
   - Dynamic equilibrium until firms make exactly zero economic profit
     - $ATC$ and Demand curve are tangential

 - As in a monopoly, $P > MC$ (because downward sloping demand curve makes $MR < P$)
 - As in a perfectly competitive market, (in the long run), $P = ATC$ (because of free entry / exit)
   - In monopoly, there is no free entry for competitors

### Monopolistic Versus Perfect Comp

 - **Excess Capacity**: Quantity Produced < Efficient Scale (Minima on $ATC$)
   - Monocomp firms have an excess capacity - it could, unlike a perf comp firm, increase the quantity it produces and lower the $ATC$ of production
   - Excess Capacity is not directly relevant for evaluation economic welfare. It tells us little about the desirability of the market outcome
 - **Markup over $MC$**: monocomp - $P > MC$ (because the firm has some market power). perfcomp - $P = MC$
   - Markup is consistent with free entry / exit and zero profit. Zero-profit condition $Rightarrow$ $P = ATC$. Does **not** imply that $P = MC$
   - In perfcomp, **at eq.** additional quantity sold doesn't raise profit (As $P = MC$)
   - In monocomp, at eq., additional quantity sold raises profit (As $P > MC$)

### Monocomp and Welfare of Society

 - Markup results in inefficiency
   - Same as deadweight loss in monopoly
 - No easy fix for policymakers
   - Need to regulate all differentiated products. But such products are really common in the economy. Administrative burden of such regulation will be overwhelming
   - Same problems as monopoly. Additionally, monocomp firms are already making zero profits at eq.
   - It is better to live with these inefficiencies of monopolistic pricing

 - Another issue, number of monocomp firms in the market may not be ideal - may be too much or too little
   - Think about it in terms of externalities associated with entry. Profit is the only consideration to enter the market. Yet it has two external effects:
     ◆ *The product-variety externality*: Because consumers get some consumer surplus from the introduction of a new product, entry of a new firm conveys a **positive externality on consumers**
     ◆ *The business-stealing externality*: Because other firms lose customers and profits from the entry of a new competitor, entry of a new firm imposes a **negative externality on existing firms**
   - Based on the sign $\pm$, there are too many or too few firms in the market
   - Both of these externalities are closely related to the conditions for monopolistic competition:
     - The product-variety externality arises because a new firm would offer a product different from those of the existing firms
     - The business-stealing externality arises because firms post a price above marginal cost and, therefore, are always eager to sell additional units
   - Conversely, because perfectly competitive firms produce identical goods and charge a price equal to marginal cost, neither of these externalities exists under perfect competition

 - Monocomp don't have the desirable welfare properties of perfcomp
   - Invisible hand doesn't maximize Total Surplus
   - Inefficiencies are subtle, hard to measure and hard to fix

## Advertising

 - Each monocomp firm needs to convince that their (slightly) differentiated product is the best
   - Highly differentiated consumer goods - Eg: perfumes, soft drinks, breakfast cereals spend a lot
   - Industrial goods - Eg: Satellites spend very little
   - Homogenous products - Eg: wheat, rice, crude oil spend nothing

 - **Critique of Advertising:**
   - People's tastes are manipulated. Psychological over informational (subconscious and subtle to create a desire that otherwise might not exist)
   - Impedes competition by fostering brand loyalty and convincing consumers
 - **Defense of Advertising:**
   - Provide information to customers - price of good, existence of new product and location of retail store. Helps market allocate resources efficiently
   - Fosters competition as customers are now better informed about firms in the market

### Advertising as a Signal of Quality

 - The willingness of the firm to spend a large amount of money on advertising can itself be a signal to consumers about the quality of the product being offered
 - Content of ad is irrelevant as advertising itself is very expensive

### Brand Name

 - Firms with a brand name spend more advertising and charge a higher price for their products
 - Are consumers rational to prefer brand names over generic substitutes?
 - **Critics**: Brand names cause consumers to perceive differences that do not really exist
   - An irrationality fostered by advertising
 - **Defendents**: Brand names ensure that the goods are of high quality
   - Firstly, they provide information about quality (explained in previous section)
   - Secondly, brand names give an incentives ot firms to **maintain** high quality

## Conclusion & Summary

 - Monocomp is a hybrid of monopoly and perfcomp
   - Like a monopoly:
     - Downward sloping demand curve
     - $P > MC$
     - Deadweight loss (due to markup)
   - Like a perfcomp:
     - Many firms
     - Free entry / exit (drives profits to zero)
   - Different from perfcomp:
     - Has excess capacity (as it operates on downward sloping part of $ATC$)
     - Markup over $MC$
 - Three attributes of monocomp:
   - Many firms
   - Differentiated products
   - Free entry / exit
 - Ability of policymakers to correct monocomp inefficiencies is limited
