# HS 101: Macroeconomics Endsems

> HS 101: Economics

> Stick to Dornbusch and Fischer, 6th Edition: Chapters 1, 2, 3 and 11, 12, 13, 14 please see the Contents Page. 
However, I am sure that you will use the Book to Complement my Lectures or the other way round. Only reading the Book Chapters will perhaps Not do!

## Great Depression

 - FED was expected to stabilize the economy
   - Honeymoon phase till 1920 had a stock market boom
   - In 1928, FED attempted to raise interest rates to discourage stock speculation and cool-down the market (to calm the peak) $\rightarrow$ this brought an initial recession
   - In a knee-jerk reaction, firms cut back on purchase of producer durable goods and on further production $\rightarrow$ thereby cutting down on labour. Consumers went into disaster control and started buying fewer goods (consumer durables)
   - Cyclic issue: Workers had no money to spend $\rightarrow$ Goods weren't being bought $\rightarrow$ Firms didn't have an incentive to hire $\rightarrow$ Workers remained poor
 - Great Depression (1929) was the deepest and longest-lasting economic downturn in the history of the Western industrialized world. It was unprecedented
   - Banks had failed
   - In 1933, u'ment rate was 25%
 - High u'ment $\rightarrow$ low employment $\rightarrow$ low income (+ bank failures) $\rightarrow$ low demand $\rightarrow$ low output
   - Great Depression caused
     - Deflation
     - Deposit Loss
 - 1932 Presidential Elections chiefly depended on this and its possible remedies
   - Republican Herbert Hoover depended on Adam Smith's Invisible Hand and natural recovery
   - Democrat Franklin D Roosevelt adopted Keynesian Economics and a more proactive approach / "a new deal" (Won)

### Causes of Great Depression

 - **High Tariffs and Ware Debts**:
   - First World War had already happened and they were carrying the weight of it

 - **Monetary Policy**:
   - People were borrowing to invest in the stock market
   - So FED raised the interest to cool down the market. Little did they know, the peak had already been crossed. A natural recession was coming

 - **Unequal Distribution of Wealth**:
   - The rich-poor divide was partially caused by the limited government involvement in the past
   - During the Great Depression, the rich got poor and the poor got poorer

 - **Over Production**:
   - Classisists believed supply created its own demand
     - They were ridiculously wrong
   - During the Great Depression, people couldn't buy the already produced products due to prices
   - Prices kept increasing and firms cut down on new production due to the apparent loss of consumption (which was due to the price in the first place). This is termed as *glut* - an excessively abundant supply of something

 - **Stock Market Crash and Financial Panic**:

 - U'ment was caused as there were excess labours supplied but no takers

## Classical Economics

 - Before 1930s, depended on Adam Smith's theories - self-equilibrating economy
   - Everything (reaching eq.) will happen on its own
 - Say's Law: Supply creates its own demand
   - LOL
 - The Great Depression tore throught the heart of its principles

 - Gives rise to: **Keynesian Economics: Output is demand determined**
   - Demand **causes** supply
   - 1930 was the year macroeconomics began
   - Aggregate Demand (AD) driven macro theory
 - In classical economics, eq. is always attained (and that too naturally)
   - Overproduction was believed to create its own demand
 - Neo-classical ideas couldn't explain or offer policy solutions 
   - No diagonosis $\rightarrow$ no solution
   - There was no admittance that the policy implemented was the cause for the depression
 - Keynes claimed that it is possible for high u'ment and underutilized capacity to persist in market economies
   - Government fiscal (relating to government revenue, especially taxes) and monetary policies (money supply and interest rate) can affect output and thereby reduce u'ment and shorten economic downturns
 - Post WWII, the government assured its proactive role and presence in economic activities - promoting output growth, employment and maintaining price stability

## Theories of Consumption

 - There are multiple theories
 - It is a behavioural function
 $$Disposable\ Income\ (Y_D) \Leftrightarrow Consumption\ per\ capita$$
 They strongly move together year-on-year
 - Remember that consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production as Adam Smith says
   - It constitutes the largest component of AD and is quite stable year-on-year (changes are proportionately smaller than GDP)
 - The real $Y_D \rightarrow$ linear form (for simplicity of analysis)
   $$C = \bar{C} + cY_D$$
   $\bar{C} > 0
   - There will be some **autonomous consumption** $\rightarrow$ consumption when you have zero income
   - The slope of the graph gives the **induced consumption** $\rightarrow$ MPC
 - Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC or c):
 $$MPC = \frac{dC}{dY}$$
 0 < MPC < 1
 The Keynesian model suggests a high value of MPC. Consumption demand has a very high importance in an economy
 - Average Propensity to Consume (APC):
 $$APC = \frac{C}{Y}$$
 APC > MPC (as $APC = \frac{\bar{C}}{Y_D} + MPC$)

## Absolute Income Hypothesis (AIH) / Keynes Consumption Theory

 - Increase consumption as income increases (proportionality constant = MPC)
 - A fundamental Psychological law
 1. **Keynes' Conjecture:** $APC$ **falls as income rises**. Rich people save a higher proportion of their income than the poor
 2. 0 < MPC < 1
 3. Income is the primary determinant of consumption (not the interest rate on your savings) as it is the largest component
 - Empirical evidence that wealthier people have lower $MPC$ than poor people
   - This is in stark contrast to the beliefs of classical economists
 - $MPC + MPS = 1$
 $MPS$ marginal propensity to save
 - $APC + APS = 1$
 $APC$ average propensity to save
 - Rich people and rich countries have high saving rates
 $$S = Y_D - C$$
 What is not consumed, is saved
 - Consumption gradually saturates
   - In the far extreme, $MPC$ reduces as income increases

### Failures of AIH

 - **Empirical data over half a century suggested $APC$ was fairly stable (not decreasing as acc. to the hypothesis) in the long run**

## Life-Cycle Hypothesis (LCH)

 - Individuals plan their consumption and savings in the best possible way over their lifetime
   - Plans are made to allow stable and smooth consumption throughout their lifetime (especially at old age)
     - Save during periods of high income and dissave during periods of low income
   - Age structure of the population is an important determinant of consumption and saving behaviour
 - For simplicity, this hypothesis assumes zero interest rate and no inflation and constant income for few years and no income in the remaining years
 $$C = \frac{(W + RY)}{T}$$
 W: intial wealth, T: years in lifetime, R: # working years, Y: income during working years
 - Consumption depends on both income and wealth
 $$C = \alpha W + \beta Y$$
 $\alpha$ < $\beta$
 $$APC = \alpha \frac{W}{Y} + \beta$$
   - In the short run, (wealth is constant) income increases, $APC$ decreases
   - In the long run, the wealth-income ratio is almost constant and thus a constant $APC$
 - *LCH* is like a triangle with first half trapezoid saving and second half trapezoid dissaving

## Business Cycles

 - Peak-recession-recovery-trough-... about the trend / potential output line
 - Greater employment $\leftrightarrow$ higher level of GDP
 - Okun's law: An annual 2.5% increase in the rate of real GDP growth above the trend line results in a 1% decrease in u'ment
 $$\frac{Y - Y^P}{Y^P} = \alpha (U - U^N)$$
 $\alpha$ < 0, potential output, natural rate of u'ment
 - GDP increases:
   1. U'ment decreases
   2. Inflation increases

### Causes of Business Cycles

 - Changes in capital expenditures
 - Innovation and imitation
 - Credit and loan policies of commercial banks
 - External shocks

## Permanent Income Hypothesis

 - Income changes:
   - Random / temporary / transitory
   - Permanent
 - Consumption depends primarily on permanent income
 $$C = \alpha Y^P$$
 permanent income
 - Kuznet is some Keynes killer
 - Price decreases $\rightarrow$ Real value of money increases $\rightarrow$ consumers feel wealthier $\rightarrow$ consumer spends more $\rightarrow$ larger GDP
   - Wealth effect

## Investment

 - Second largest component of AD
 - Large and highly volatile
   - Affects business cycles
 - Promotes economic growth in the long run
 1. Business fixed invt - biggest and most volatile
   - Requires continuous refuelling in terms of positive year-on-year net investment to compensate for depreciation
 2. Residential invt
 3. Inventory invt

 - Marginal Rate of Invt should be above going interest rate to make the invt worthwhile
