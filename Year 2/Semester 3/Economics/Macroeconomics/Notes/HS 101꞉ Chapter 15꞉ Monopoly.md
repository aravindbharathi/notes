# HS 101: Chapter 15: Monopoly

> HS 101: Economics

 - Competitve firm - *price taker*
 - Monopoly firm - *price maker*
   - Because of its *market power*
   - Removes constraint between price and cost on firm
 - Monopolies cannot achieve any level of profit they want, because high prices reduce the amount that their customers buy
   - Although monopolies can control the prices of their goods, their profits are not unlimited (even though they are unchecked by competition)
   - The invisible hand doesn't play a part here. Government does
   - Outcomes needn't always be in the best interest of the society

## Monopolies

 - **A firm that is the sole seller of a product without close substitutes**
 - It causes barrier to entry

### Monopoly over resources

 - **If a single firm owns a key resource**
 - In practice, this reason is rarely the cause for monopolies because actualy economies are very large and resources are owned by many people 
 - Eg: Owner of the one and only well in a village
 - Eg: DeBeers (South Africa) over diamonds.
   - Additionally, they create ads trying to imply that diamonds are the most superior gemstone

### Government-created monopolies

 - Eg: An empire's ruler granting the exclusive business rights to friends and allies
 - Sometimes government give them to centralize (in view of public interest)
 - Granting patents and copyrights
   - An author is the sole owner (and seller) of their book
 - Encourages the beneficiary to work / produce / research more (incentives for creative activity)

### Natural Monopoly

 - **A monopoly that arises because a single firm can supply a good or service to an entire market at a smaller cost than could two or more firms**
   - Due to economies of scale
   - $ATC$ continuously declines (mostly negative exponential)
 - Excludable: Prevent someone from using something
   - Rival: One person using something diminishes the ability of others to use the same thing
 - Eg: Google over Smartphone Operating Systems
 - Natural monopolies are less concerned about new entrants eroding its market power
   - Sometimes, they can even outright buy a rising competitor
 - But such firms come under the scrutiny of the government lens
 - As market expands, a natural monopoly **can** evolve into a competitive market

## Monopoly Production And Pricing Decisions

 - Competitive firm demand curve (P vs Q) - flat
   - Perfectly elastic demand curve
 - Monopolistic firm demand curve - negatively sloping
   - Raises price $\leftrightarrow$ customers buy less
   - This constraints the monopoly's ability to profit from its market power
 - Remember goal of any firm is profit maximization
 $$Profit = TR - TC$$

### Monopoly's Revenue

 $$TR = P \times Q$$
 $PQ is a hyperbola$ while Demand curve is linear. Tangent point, is profit maximization
 $$AR = \frac{TR}{Q}$$
 Remember $P = AR$
 $$MR = \frac{\Delta TR}{\Delta Q}$$
 A monopolist's $MR$ is always less than the price of the good ($MR$ can become negative)
 - The (linear) $MR$ curve is always below the Demand Curve intersecting at the y(Price) intercept
 - To increase amount sold, price must reduce. Its effects on $TR$:
 ◆ *The output effect*: More output is sold, so Q is higher
 ◆ *The price effect*: The price falls, so P is lower

 - A **competitive firm** can sell all it wants at the market price (there is no price effect)
   - When it increases production by 1 unit, it receives the market price for that unit and it does not receive any less for the amount it was already selling ($MR = P$)
 - By contrast, when a monopoly increases production by 1 unit, it must reduce the price it charges for every unit it sells

### Proftit Maximization

 - When $MR > MC$, increase production
 - When $MR < MC$, decrease production
 - Equilibrium at $MR = MC$
   - Competitive firm: $P = MR = MC$
   - Monopolistic firm: $P > MR = MC$
     - Profit Maxima at P on Demand Curve equal to that Q

> A monopoly does not have a supply curve. 
> A supply curve tells us the quantity that firms choose to supply at any given price. This concept makes sense when we are analyzing competitive firms, which are price takers. But a monopoly firm is a price maker.
> It is not meaningful to ask what such a firm would produce at any price because the firm sets the price at the same time it chooses the quantity to supply. 
> Indeed, the monopolist’s decision about how much to supply is impossible to separate from the demand curve it faces. The shape of the demand curve determines the shape of the marginal-revenue curve, which in turn determines the monopolist’s profit-maximizing quantity. In a competitive market, supply decisions can be analyzed without knowing the demand curve, but that is not true in a monopoly market. Therefore, we never talk about a monopoly’s supply curve.

### Monopoly's Profit

 $$Profit = (P - ATC) \times Q$$
 Same as competitive firm

## Welfare Cost Of Monopoly

 - Monopolies charge a price above $MC$
   - Undesirable from a consumer standpoint
   - Need to compare benefits to firm owners vs costs to consumers
 - Total Surplus = Consumer Surplus + Producer Surplus
   - Consumer Surplus = Consumer's *WTP* - What consumers pay
   - Produce Surplus = What producers receive - Producer's production cost
 - Invisible hand $\rightarrow$ desirable allocation of resource $\rightarrow$ maximizes total surplus (and thereby economic well-being)

### Deadweight Loss

 - Socially efficient quantity of production is where the demand curve and marginal curve intersect, ie, $P = MC$
 - Monopolist produces less than efficient quantity
   - Some consumers value the good at more than its $MC$ but less than the price the monopolistic firm charges (Remember, $P > MC$)
   - Similar, deadweight loss wedge (Total surplus lost because of monopoly pricing)
     - Quantity sold falls short of social optimum
     - Tax wedge: Government gets revenue
     - Here, Monopoly gets additional profit
 - The problem a monopoly causes is this loss in total surplus value causing a low and inefficient quantity of output
   - And a vastly unequal split in the resulting Total Surplus

## Public Policy Towards Monopolies

 - Policymakers in the government respond to this inefficient allocation of resources by:
 ◆ By trying to make monopolized industries more competitive
 ◆ By regulating the behavior of the monopolies
 ◆ By turning some private monopolies into public enterprises
 ◆ By doing nothing at all

### Antitrust Laws

 - Stop high-fi mergers
   - Eg: Coca-Cola and Pepsi, Intel and AMD
 - Curb monopolistic market power to preserve free and unfettered competition (as the rule of trade)
 - Allow government to break up companies - like what they are doing to Google (and what they attempted to do to Microsoft in 2000)
 - Prevent companies from coordinating activities that make markets less competitive
 - *Synergies*: Merger to lower cost of production (through efficient joint production)

### Regulation

 - Price ceilings
   - Generally avoid $MC$ as the ceiling as it won't give incentives to further reduce costs of production (one of the goals of the firm). In some cases, $MC$ might even lead to losses for the firm

### Public Ownership

 - Economists prefer private to public ownership
   - Corruption
   - No incentive to reduce cost of production

### Doing Nothing

 - Above methods have drawbacks
 - Sometimes better to leave alone

## Price Discrimination

 - **The business practice of selling the same good at different prices to different customers**
   - Remember, cost of producing **for** anyone is still the same
 - Can't take place in competitive markets

 - Eg: Die-hard Apple fans willing to shell out $1600 for an iPhone (600 such people) or pricing the same at $800 so that any (or atleast most) enthusiasts (1000 such people) can buy (*WTP*)
 - Remember, this is a rational decision for the firm (which aims at profit-maximization)

 - *Arbitrage*: The process of buying a good in one market at a low price and selling it in another market at a higher price (in order to profit from the price difference)
 - Price Discrimination can result in (economically) efficient outcome

 - **Perfect Price Discrimination**: A situation where the monopolist knows the exact *WTP* of every customer
   - Eliminates deadweight loss
   - Customer Surplus = zero, Producer Surplus = Total Surplus
 - Above all, price discrimination increases monopoly's profit

 - Eg: Discount coupons in newspapers, flight ticket / movie ticket prices, financial aids for college students, quantity discounts

## Conclusion & Summary

 - Monopoly power is a matter of degree of extent
 - Market power leads to positive economic profit for the firm and a deadweight loss for society
