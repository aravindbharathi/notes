# Mankiw HS 101: Chapter 14: Unemployment And Its Natural Rate

> HS 101: Economics

 - Measuring unemployment
 - Unemployment and job search
 - Unemployment and minimum wage laws
 - Unemployment from firms-unions bargaining
 - Efficiency wages

 - U'ment is an (obvious) determinant of a country's standard of living
 - Problems of u'ment is divided into two categories: long-run and short-run
 - Natural rate of u'ment, cyclical u'ment(year-to-year fluctuations in unemployment around its natural rate)

## Identifying Unemployment

### Measuring Unemployment

 - Categories (for adult population only): 
   1. Employed
   2. Unemployed
   3. Not in labour force (full-time students, retirees)

$$Labour\ Force = \# Employed + \# Unemployed$$

$$Unemployment\ Rate = \frac{\# Unemployed}{Labour Force} \times 100$$

$$Labour\ Force\ Participation\ Rate = \frac{Labour\ Force}{Adult\ Population} \times 100$$

 - In the current chapter, short-run fluctuations are ignored
 - New technology, birth control, and changing political and social attitudes

### Problems in Interpreting Unemployment Data

 - Most unemployed people are recent entrants into the labour force
 - Types of Unemployed people:
   - Trying hard for a job
   - Calling themselves so to receive (unemployed-only) financial assistance
   - "Under-the-table" paid workers
 - Discouraged Workers: Individuals who would like to work but have given up looking for a job
   - 1999 estimate +0.5% (to calculated unemployment rate)
 - Unemployment rate is a useful but imperfect measure of joblessness

### Duration of Unemployment

 - Either short-term(few weeks) or long-term(few months)
 - Most spells of unemployment are short, and most unemployment observed at any given time is long-term
   - Eg: In a year, $\frac{52}{55}$ remain unemployed for a week while the other 3 remain unemployed for a year
   - Most spells of unemployment are short
   - Most unemployment observed at any given time is long-term
 - Most people who become unemployed will soon find jobs. Yet most of the economy’s unemployment problem is attributable to the relatively few workers who are jobless for long periods of time

### Natural Rate of Unemployment

 - Supply and Demand Curves are too ideal (reality doesn't resemble this ideal)
 1. **Frictional Unemployment**: Workers take time to search for the jobs that are best suited for them
   - Explains short spells of u'ment
 2. **Structural Unemployment**: # jobs available is insufficient to give a job to everyone who wants one
   - QD > QS (Given wages are above equilibrium). Explains longer spell of u'ment
   - Causes $\Rightarrow$ minimum-wage laws, unions and efficiency wages

## Job Search

 - The process by which workers find appropriate jobs given their **tastes and skills**
   - Matchmaking

### Frictional Unemployment

 - Due to changes in the composition of demand among industries or regions
   - They are called sectoral shifts
   - It takes time for workers to search for jobs in the new sectors, sectoral shifts temporarily cause unemployment
 - Inevitable, because the economy is always changing (end result of the latter has been higher productivity and higher living standards)

### Public Policy

 - Internet and public policy can reduce frictional u'ment by reducing time it takes unemployed workers to find new jobs
 - Government-run employment agencies, public training programs (ease transition of workers from declining to growing industries)
   - Government might be no better (or even worse) at disseminating the right information to the right workers and deciding what kinds of worker training would be most valuable

### Unemployment Insurance

 - A government program that partially protects workers’ incomes when they become unemployed
 - Increases the amount of frictional u'ment
   - Quit, fired with reason or new entrants are not eligible

## Minimum Wage Laws

 - Minimum-wage laws are binding most often for the least skilled and least experienced members of the labor force, such as teenagers
   - Explains existence of u'ment among these workers
   - Minimum wage > Equilibrium of S&D Curve
   - Here, Surplus = U'ment
 - Frictional u'ment $\Rightarrow$ Searching for jobs
 - Structural u'ment $\Rightarrow$ Waiting for jobs openings

## Unions And Collective Bargaining

 - A worker association that bargains with employers over wages and working conditions

### Economics of Unions

 - Collective Bargaining: The process by which unions and firms agree on the terms of employment
 - Unions exert their joint market power
 - Strike: The organized withdrawal of labor from a firm by a union
 - Increasing wage leaves the employed better off (insiders) but some lose their jobs
   - Some (already unemployed) can't even get the job now (outsiders)
   - It also affects those who aren't even part of a union
 - Normally, explicit agreements among members of a cartel are illegal. If firms that sell a common product were to agree to set a high price for that product, the agreement would be a “conspiracy in restraint of trade.” The government would prosecute these firms in civil and criminal court for violating the antitrust laws 
   - By contrast, unions are exempt from these laws. The policymakers who wrote the antitrust laws believed that workers needed greater market power as they bargained with employers

### Economic effects of Unions

 - Against: (Unions) Raising wages makes the allocation of labour inefficient and inequitable
   - Reduced employment in unionized firms below the efficient, competitive level
   - Some workers benefit at the expense of other workers
 - For: Necessary antidote to contend market power of firms
   - Firms respond efficiently to workers' (as part of a union) concerns

## Efficiency Wages

 - Above-equilibrium wages paid by firms in order to increase worker productivity
   - Profitable for firms to keep wages high even in the presence of labour surplus
   - (Illustrates a general principle of adverse selection)
     - Sellers of used cars know their vehicles' defects while buyers often do not
     - In an employment relationship
       - Firm = *Principal*
       - Worker = *Agent*
     - According to *worker-effort variant* of *efficiency-wage theory*, high wages reduce the problem of *moral hazard*
       - A babysitter allows children to watch more television than the parents of the children prefer. The reason is that more educational activities require more energy from the babysitter, even though they are beneficial for the children
 - In all three cases (of structural u'ment), the cause is the wage above eq. level

#### Worker Health
 - Better pay $\rightarrow$ better diet

#### Worker Turnover
 - People respond to incentives
   - By keeping the existing in the job, firms don't need to hire and train new workers

#### Worker Effort
 - Higher pay, workers put in more effort
   - Also unemployed people are lurking to take their job (if they get fired)

#### Worker Quality
 - Based on the assumption that more competent workers demand higher salaries

### Ford's 5-dollar wage

 - Turnover fell, absenteeism fell and productivity rose
 - Production costs were lower even though wages were higher

## Conclusion & Summary

 - Measurement of u'ment and reasons why economies always face some degree of u'ment

## Key Concepts

 - Natural Rate of Unemployment: The normal rate of unemployment around which the unemployment rate fluctuates
 - Cyclical Unemployment: The deviation of unemployment from its natural rate

## Extra

 - Employment rate and wage rate $\rightarrow$ labour market
 - Exchange rate $\rightarrow$ international trade
 - Interest rate $\rightarrow$ debt market

 - High u'ment $\rightarrow$ low income $\rightarrow$ low demand for G&S $\rightarrow$ less output
