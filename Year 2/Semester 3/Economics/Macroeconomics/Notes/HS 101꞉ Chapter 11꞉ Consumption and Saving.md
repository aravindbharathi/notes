# HS 101: Chapter 11: Consumption and Saving

> HS 101: Economics

 - Consumption purchases account for more than 60% of AD
   - Understand the driving forces for consumption to understand the forces on AD
 - Consumption impacts saving
 $$NNP = GNP - Depreciation$$
 - Life-cycle theory
 - Permanent-income theory

## Life-Cycle Theory

 - Consumption Function assumes an individual's Consumption Behaviour in a **given period** is related to their income in **that period**
 - In Life-cycle hypothesis, individuals plan their consumption and saving behaviour for their lifetime
   - A desire to provide for consumption at old age
   - Age structure of the population is an important behaviour of consumption and saving behaviour
   $$C = aW_R + cY_L$$
   where WR is real wealth, a is the Marginal Propensity to consume out of savings, YL is labour income, c is the usual MPC
   - C is assumed to be a constant throughout their lifetime
     - World without inflation, and no interest on savings. Also they are born with $0 and die with $0
   $$C \times N_L = Y_L \times W_L$$

### Saving and Dissaving

 $$S = Y_L - C = \frac{NL - WL}{NL} \times Y_L$$
 - Saving rate during working life is equal to the proportion of life spent in retirement
 - Saving during working years = dissaving during retirement
 - More practically, consumption plans are made to achieve a smooth and even level of consumption by saving during periods of high income and dissaving during periods of low income
   - This is an **important departure** from the treatment of consumption as being based on current income

#### Assets

 $$W_{R,max} = Y_L \times \frac{(N_L - W_L)}{N_L}W_L = C \times (NL - WL)$$

### Wealth to Begin With

 $$C = aW_R + cY_L\ \ a=\frac{1}{(N_L - T)}\ \ c = \frac{(W_L - T)}{N_L - T)}$$
 where T is the number of years that have passed
 - if c < 0, set c to 0

### Aggregate Consumption and Saving

 - Aggregate Consumption and Saving depend on age distribution of the population
 - Aggregate Saving depends on the age of retirement (older it is, less an individual needs to save for retirement)

## Permanent Income Theory

 - Argues that consumption is not related to current income, but a longer term estimate of income
 $$C = cY_P$$
 where YP is permanent disposable income

### Estimating $Y_P$

 - Permanent income is the steady rate of consumption a person could maintain for the rest of their life (given the present level of wealth, and income earned now and in the future)
 - Any fluctuations in current income should be termed either permanent or transitory
   - Transitory income will not have a substantial effect on consumption
 $$Y_P = Y_{-1} + \theta(Y - Y_{-1})$$
 where 0 < $\theta$ < 1 is the fractional increase from last year's income
 - If $Y = Y_{-1}$, then $Y_P = Y = Y_{-1}$
 - If income rises this year, then permanent income rises by less than the current income

### Dynamics of Consumption

 $$C = cY_P = c\theta Y + c(1 - \theta)Y_{-1}$$
