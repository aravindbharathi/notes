# Mankiw HS 101: Chapter 11: Measuring The Cost Of Living

> HS 101: Economics

 - Measure overall cost of living
 - Consumer Price Index
 - Monitor changes in the cost of living over time
 - Inflation (key variable guiding macroeconomic policy)

## Consumer Price Index

 - **A measure of the overall cost of the goods and services by a typical consumer**

### Calculating CPI

 1. Fix the basket: Determine the proportions of each product purchased
 2. Find the prices: of each good at each point in time
 3. Compute the basket's cost: P $\times$ Q
 4. Choose a base year and compute CPI: $$CPI = \frac{Price\ of\ basket\ in\ given\ year}{Price\ of\ basket\ in\ base\ year} \times 100$$
 5. Compute the Inflation Rate: $$Inflation = \frac{CPI_{year\ 2} - CPI_{year\ 1}}{CPI_{year\ 1}} \times 100$$
###
 1. Housing: Rent, utilities, furnishings and operation
 2. Transportation
 3. Food

### Problems in Measuring the Cost of Living

 - Goal of CPI: Measure changes in the cost of living
   - Gauge necessary increase in income to maintain (constant) standard of living
   - Not a perfect measure
 - **Substitution bias**: CPI is computed assuming a **fixed basket of goods**. By not taking into account the possibility of consumer substitution (toward goods that have become relatively less expensive), the index **overstates the increase** in the cost of living from one year to the next
 - **Introduction of new goods**: The basket doesn't accomodate new products while these new products affect the sold quantities of existing products
 - **Unmeasured quality change**: If the quality of a good deteriorates from one year to the next, the value of a dollar falls, even if the price of the good stays the same. Changes in quality are hard to measure
 - 1999, subtract 1% off calculated CPI for actual CPI

### GDP Deflator Versus CPI

 -  GDP deflator reflects the prices of all G&S **produced domestically**, whereas the consumer price index reflects the prices of all G&S **bought by consumers**
   - Eg: When the price of oil rises, the consumer price index rises by much more than does the GDP deflator 
 - CPI $\rightarrow$ fixed basket of goods. GDP $\rightarrow$ all goods
   - The difference is not important when all prices change proportionately
   - When they change by varying amounts, the way the basket is weighted matters
 - Divergence between these two measures is the exception rather than the rule

## Correcting Economic Variables For The Effects Of Inflation

$$Price_{year\ 2} = Price_{year\ 1} \times \frac{PI_{year\ 2}}{PI_{year\ 1}}$$

### Indexation

 - Indexation: The correction of a currency amount for the effects of inflation by law or contract
 - Cost of living allowance (COLA) automatically raises the wage when the CPI rises
   - Even income tax brackets are indexed for inflation (sometimes)

### Real and Nominal Interest Rates

 - Comparing purchasing power to interest rate
 $$Real\ Interest\ Rate = Nominal\ Interest\ Rate - Inflation\ Rate$$
 - Nominal Interest Rate: The interest rate as usually reported without a correction for the effects of inflation
 - Real Interest Rate: The interest rate corrected for the effects of inflation
 - The nominal interest rate tells you how fast the **number of dollars** in your bank account rises over time. The real interest rate tells you how fast the **purchasing power** of your bank account rises over time

## Conclusion & Summary

 - Measuring macroeconomic quantities and prices

## Key Concepts

 - Inflation Rate: The percentage change in the price index from the preceding period
 - Producer Price Index (PPI): A measure of the cost of a basket of goods and services bought by firms
